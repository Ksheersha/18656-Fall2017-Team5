9998,A XML-based Description Language and Execution Environment for Orchestrating Grid Jobs.,"Grids are often used through simplified job submission interfaces that abstract the underlying grid infrastructure as a black box. These interfaces suit well to developers of simple grid applications requiring the coordination of grid jobs, for which monitoring and error handling are done more or less manually. However, developers of advanced grid applications such as grid portals need more flexible tools to develop efficient and robust applications with advanced capabilities such as monitoring, error handling, failure recovery, resource release, etc. In this paper, we present through a typical application example a XML-based language designed to describe applications orchestrating grid jobs. We also present the execution environment supporting the proposed language and we show how even simple grid applications can be expressed in this language and benefit of the advanced capabilities of the execution environment.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
9999,Service-based Collaborative Workflow for DAME.,"The paper reports on research to design and implement a service-based, secure collaborative workflow system for Distributed Aircraft Maintenance Environment (DAME). This has been developed by the Universities of York, Sheffield, Oxford and Leeds, and industrial partners, Rolls-Royce and Data Systems and Solutions (DS&S). DAME is a prototype system to support aircraft engine maintenance and predictive services. It is an example of a virtual organisation with grid-based services running at the four universities sites. To meet the industrial requirements strong security is implemented to protect commercially sensitive services and data. Application services have been coordinated using the DAME workflow management system to automate business processes and control collaborative access. A dynamic workflow-team policy is used to authorise user access to workflow instances and corresponding service instances. The paper includes aspects of an initial evaluation with the industrial participants and illustrates the feasibility of using DAME in an industrial environment.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10000,Service-Oriented Agility: An initial analysis for the use of Agile methods for SOA development.,"Today, businesses have to respond with flexibility and speed to ever-changing customer demand, market opportunities and external threats. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a special way to look a IT systems, focusing on their adaptability - the ability to respond to changing and new requirements. It is more than evident that agile approaches to software development seem to be a natural fit for developing such systems. In this article, we try to harden this evidence. We take a look on the fundamentals of agile software development and assess their suitability for SOA-based systems.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10002,Reckoning Legislative Compliances with Service Oriented Architecture A Proposed Approach.,"Recent accounting scandals involving firms such as such as Enron, Worldcom, Tyco etc. have resulted in the emergence of stringent regulations aimed at safeguarding the interest of enterprise stakeholders. Important regulations such as Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the US PATRIOT act in US and the International Accounting Standards (IAS) regulation in Europe have diverse and far reaching effects. Organizations are mandated to comply with these regulations by producing certain documents and reports during the audit. This calls for appropriate extensible document lifecycle management solutions involving integration and reconciliation of stored data from heterogeneous sources with quick detailing. This is because these regulations demand easy accessibility of data. While point solutions to document life cycle management exist, they are not cost effective. The paradigm of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) which emphasizes software development based on well abstracted services has presented application development and adaptation a new dimension. SOA will enable flexible deployment of shared reusable compliance services thereby yielding malleable and cost effective compliance solutions. In this paper, we provide a logical SOA based approach for achieving compliance in enterprises and illustrate this approach for a typical compliance need.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10003,Constraint Driven Web Service Composition in METEOR-S.,"Creating Web processes using Web service technology gives us the opportunity for selecting new services which best suit our need at the moment. Doing this automatically would require us to quantify our criteria for selection. In addition, there are challenging issues of correctness and optimality. We present a Constraint Driven Web Service Composition tool in METEOR-S, which allows the process designers to bind Web Services to an abstract process, based on business and process constraints and generate an executable process. Our approach is to reduce much of the service composition problem to a constraint satisfaction problem. It uses a multi-phase approach for constraint analysis. This work was done as part of the METEOR-S framework, which aims to support the complete lifecycle of semantic Web processes.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10005,A Comparison of Alternative Web Service Allocation and Scheduling Policies.,"Web Services (WSs) are emerging as the building block of Internet scale database management systems (IDBMSs).These systems must intelligently execute plans that reference autonomous WSs.This requires policies and mechanisms for both scheduling and allocating WSs that constitute a plan.In this study, we analyze two scheduling strategies and four allocation policies.Obtained results show that dynamic scheduling with Least Response Time (LRT) allocation policy is superior to other alternatives when the service time of a WS can be estimated accurately.The traditional Least Recently Used (LRU) allocation policy is inferior to all policies including Random. These observations are important because they impact the scalability of a system.Only with a smart allocation policy, one should expect improved system performance by increasing the number of nodes that constitute an IDBMS to support a larger number of WS replicas.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10006,A Generalized Framework for Providing QoS Based Registry in Service Oriented Architecture.,"This paper provides a generalized approach for building a QoS Based Registry for Service Oriented Architecture. This framework enhances the current Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) standard in order to achieve better search efficiency and improved quality of search based on user specified QoS parameters. The proposed model does not require any changes or modification to the current UDDI standard but provides a middleware repository that is used to store a valid subset of the UDDI data with QoS specifications. The proposed framework is expandable to include additional quality of service parameters depending on the application. The implementation of this framework illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed QoS based registry.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10007,Perspectives on Service Oriented Architecture.,"SOA and Web Services are the hottest topics of discussion currently with regards to enterprise architecture. The technologies are maturing from a standardization perspective and the level of understanding of various aspects of a SOA is gradually rising with an increasing number of clients thinking about service implementation and adoption. This trend has generated significant interest in IT and business circles alike, owing to the promise of bridging the gap between business strategists and IT architects. Service Oriented Architecture builds upon decades of distributed computing technologies and advocates the delivery of software applications in the form of an open interface based on strict contracts, leading to loosely coupled systems which are implementation independent. This tutorial will focus on providing an overview of service oriented architecture with emphasis on the evolution of SOA from other technologies such as object oriented programming and distributed computing. Subsequently, the tutorial will delve into exploring SOA from multiple perspectives, such as the relevance of SOA in EAI, SOA features of J2EE and .NET apart from illustrating specific recommendations on migrating to SOA based on some sample implementations.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10008,Progressive Auction Based Resource Allocation in Service-Oriented Architecture.,"The emerging paradigm of distributed Web services has promised seamless business integration across the Internet that shares not only computing power but also applications. One major challenge is resource allocation to each end user in an economically efficient and low latency manner. A common solution is proportional sharing where each user gets his resource in proportion to the predetermined weight. However, this does not allow users to differentiate the value of their services and to dynamically adjust the weights. A resource reservation mechanism may improve the information and service sharing but usually introduces a high latency. In this paper, we propose a progressive auction based market mechanism for resource allocation that allows user differentiation of the service value and ensures the resource acquisition latency to be limited only to the communication delay in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems. We present a service sharing prototype for selecting services for further business process composition or solution creation and show experimental results on the formation of reliable user ranking in resource sharing through the progressive auction.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10009,An Advanced Accounting Service for AIX Systems.,"Resource usage is important input for a number of IT processes including those related to: Financial Management; Capacity Planning; Service Level Management; and Configuration Management. Accounting systems in traditional UNIX / Linux environments generate a usage record at the end of each process. Administrators periodically use standard accounting system utilities to summarize resource usage using the user and application data recorded with each of these records. Recent advances in Dynamic LPAR technologies and Service Oriented Architectures have placed new requirements on the metering of resource usage. In a Dynamic LPAR environment, allocations must be measured and processed to obtain accurate information on resource usage. Transactions performed using Service Oriented Architectures deployed on heterogeneous, distributed systems introduce new challenges for metering resource usage based on transaction classes. In this paper we present the design and implementation of a J2EE-based accounting service which exposes manageability and reporting interfaces for the AIX advanced accounting system. The reporting interface can be used to generate process-based, LPAR-based and transaction-based usage reports.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10010,Pyros - an environment for building and orchestrating open services.,"Service oriented computing has gained a considerable momentum as a new paradigm for building enterprise information systems. Notable efforts have been made recently from both researchers and industrials to support the construction of service-based applications, nevertheless several issues still need to be tackled including service de?nition and adaptation, and services orchestration. This work proposes PYROS, an environment for building and orchestrating open services. An open service is represented by a workflow that coordinates calls to service provider methods. Thereby component activities and the way they are synchronized are rendered visible. In order to finely orchestrate services, they are associated with entry points. An entry point acts as a gateway for inserting and getting information about the progress of service execution. The paper details the approach adopted by PYROS for building and orchestrating services, and presents associated architectural choices. Furthermore, it reports an experimentation that we conducted for implementing an eTrader application using PYROS.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10011,Toward Intention Aware Semantic Web Service Systems.,"A goal driven intention extraction approach is proposed to automate the process of extracting user intention from the original Web service request terms. We introduce a method for analyzing the request terms to fit user intension, so that the service provided will be more suitable for the user. The input terms will be parsed into different word sense sets. With the lexical dictionary and domain ontology, possible senses of the terms will be identified. A goal structure is constructed to help the identification of goal models which represent the user intention. By combining the information of request terms and goal structures, one or more goal models will be identified. A goal selector will select a candidate goal model from generated goal models to represent the user intention. A service request agent is designed to generate and execute plans to satisfy the goals.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10012,A Fine-Grained Access Control Model for Web Services.,"The emerging Web service technology has enabled the development of Internet-based applications that integrate distributed and heterogeneous systems and processes which are owned by different organizations. However, while Web services are rapidly becoming a fundamental paradigm for the development of complex Web applications, several security issues still need to be addressed.Among the various open issues concerning security, an important issue is represented by the development of suitable access control models, able to restrict access to Web services to authorized users.In this paper we present an innovative access control model for Web services.The model is characterized by a number of key features, including identity attributes and service negotiation capabilities.We also discuss an architecture implementing the model and we propose the use of a certificate scheme able to support the exchange and verification of subject attributes.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10013,Contextual Collaboration: Platform and Applications.,"Contextual collaboration refers to people-to-people collaboration from within IT-enabled business operations. We have designed and implemented a middleware platform for enabling contextual collaboration, and built collaborative applications on top of the platform. The platform embodies three main themes: on-demand, adaptive, and integrated. It is on-demand in that it allows collaboration data and services to be accessed from within business applications as the business need arises. It is adaptive in that it brings the right set of collaboration elements to the user, in a manner sensitive to business context. It integrates collaboration elements across multiple sources, multiple modalities, and multiple vendor technologies. In addition, it integrates structured collaborative activities with ad hoc peer collaboration tools, and with the business processes at large. To validate and leverage the contextual collaboration platform, we have developed an Eclipse-based collaborative development environment and a browser that enables collaborative Web applications. Our contextual collaboration platform and applications promise to yield a more productive and more satisfying business practice.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10015,Identity Based Proxy-Signcryption Scheme from Pairings.,"An identity based cryptosystem is a novel type of public cryptographic scheme in which the public keys of the users are their identities or strings derived from their identities. A signcryption is a primitive that provides private and authenticated delivery of messages between two parties. Proxy signature schemes are variations of ordinary digital signature schemes and have been shown to be useful in many applications. In this paper, We proposed an identity based proxy-signcryption scheme from pairings. Also we analyze the proposed scheme from efficiency and security points of view. Heuristic arguments have been given for those security properties. We have shown that the proxy-signcryption scheme is as efficient as ordinary identity based signcryption schemes under certain circumstances.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10016,Similarity-based Web Service Matchmaking.,"With the increasing growth in popularity of Web services, matchmaking of relevant Web services becomes a significant challenge. Commonly, Web service is described by WSDL and published on UDDI registers. UDDI provides limited search facilities allowing only a keyword-based search of businesses, services, and the so called tModels based on names and identifiers. This category-based keyword-browsing method is clearly insufficient. Semantic Web service uses DAML-S instead of WSDL to represent capabilities of Web services. This improvement enables software agents or search engines to automatically find appropriate Web services via ontologies and reasoning algorithm enriched methods. However, the high cost of formally defining to the heavy and complicated services makes this improvement widespread adoption unlikely. To cope with these limitations, we have developed a suite of methods which assesses the similarity of Web services to achieve matchmaking. In particular, we present a conceptual model which classifies properties of Web services into four categories. For each category, a similarity assessment method has been given. In Web service matchmaking process, these similarity assessment methods can be used together or individually. Experiments highlight complementary contributions that our work makes to facilitate web service matchmaking.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10017,Fair BPEL Processes Transaction using Non-Repudiation Protocols.,There is a need for protocols to achieve universal interoperability among web services and to provide a fair and secure environment with non-repudiation.

In this paper we propose and a verify nonrepudiation protocol using Petri Nets for chain-linked business transactions and show that they may be specified in BPEL.,2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10018,Decentralized Resilient Grid Resource Management Overlay Networks.,"Recently, Grid and peer-to-peer overlays have attracted attention from research communities as well as industry. However, the overwhelming majority of industrial, commercial and academic activities are geared around applications, servers, and middleware. There have been some efforts in the management of the underlying networks (the connectivity for the overlays), but far from enough. This paper proposes a resilient, fault-adaptive, overlay resource management framework, with lightweight state management infrastructure, taken from some ongoing work by the authors in this area. This research aims to solve the problems of: (a) managing distributed network resources in a decentralized way; (b) providing resilient QoS for highly dynamic networks.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10020,Case Study: Using Web Services for the Management of Environmental Data.,"CCLRC is involved in the development of grid and data management tools for a number of e-Science projects in the UK including the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) funded ""Environment from the Molecular Level"" [http://www.eminerals.org].CCLRC's web services based multidisciplinary Data Portal [http://www.e-science.clrc.ac.uk/web/projects/dataportal], uses an XML metadata model of scientific data [http://www-dienst.rl.ac.uk/library/2002/tr/dltr-2002001.pdf] to explore and access the content of data resources within CCLRC's main laboratories in the UK and other facilities in Europe.Last year CCLRC adapted the Data Portal for the project so that earth scientists could store and access their own metadata and datasets, and simultaneously access related metadata and datasets from other facilities around the world.To achieve this the Data Portal was redeveloped using Web Service technology so that the internal services could be accessed via any user interface or system specific to the e-science project community.Previously, access was provided only via a standard web browser.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10022,PEM: A Framework Enabling Continual Optimization of Workflow Process Executions Based upon Business Value Metrics.,"The competitiveness of the market place and the advent of on demand services computing are encouraging many organizations to improve their business efficiency and agility via business process management technologies. A lot of work has been done in process codification, tracking, and automation. However, a significant gap still remains between the way an organizationÂ¿s codified processes execute and the organizationÂ¿s business objectives such as maximizing profit with high-degree of customer satisfaction. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a process execution management (PEM) framework which enables continual optimization of workflow process executions based upon business value metrics such as SLA breach penalty, revenue, and customer satisfaction index. We have implemented the PEM framework based upon leading commercial products. We have also used the framework to develop two representative business performance management solutions for service quality management processes and application execution workflows. Our experimental results show that, when compared with a state-of-the-art commercial workflow product, our PEM system can reduce the loss of business value of a set of process execution requests by 67% on average.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Those that fail to embrace and use such advantages in the next years are in danger to disappear or become zombie ones. In contrast, those pioneering these next-generation technology-business strategies will gain strategic advantage. This paper is about AWS-Net Traveler, which is an Autonomic Web Services Framework for performing Business Processes in an Autonomous mode.

10027,Managing Trust in Active XML.,"Active XML [The Active XML Team, http://www-rocq.inria.fr/gemo/gemo/projects/axml/] combines XML Data and service calls to allow a simple and powerful Web services implementation. Security in Active XML is currently handled by matching the structure of the received data with an XML Schema representing the allowed data (including service calls). This solution is not fully satisfactory in case of an open environment where the services do not often know or trust each other. Moreover, the strength of Active XML lies in its simple and dynamic structure, and the modified XML Schemas used for security matching can quickly limit the allowed services, or give too much freedom to services that should not be trusted. Given that the result of an Active XML service call is some Active XML data (that may include more service calls), Active XML data is recursive, thus involving more security concerns. We propose a new framework based on the notion of Trust (Trusted Active XML) for handling security in Active XML. In this framework, ""trusted"" services' answers are not restricted to a specific data schema, while ""untrusted"" ones are prevented from performing some unwanted operations.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10028,VICOS: A Framework for Session Management in Network Computing Infrastructure.,"By introducing a virtual computing session abstraction to network computing infrastructure, and slightly extending its underlying remote display protocol, we propose VICOS (VIrtual COmputing Session): a framework of session management which provides session-level manageability, and allows multiple user to access the computing service on the server simultaneously. The virtual computing session abstraction also supports user roaming among desktops, i.e. user mobility. This framework isolates user's computing session from network or desktop failure. The session-level management mechanism provided by this framework improves the service availability and reliability. We have implemented our VICOS prototype in Linux. We demonstrate that our Linux VICOS prototype can provide general-purpose computing service with low overhead.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

We introduce a system framework for service composition. In this framework, a workflow defines a generic and serviceindependent process model within which each service agent is able to select appropriate task node that fits for the end user requirement in run time. Specifically, agents will negotiate with one other to guarantee the satisfaction of the service consumersÂ¿ requirements. This paper introduces a methodology of how to model a service composition as a constraint satisfaction problem and solve the problem by a multi-agent negotiation algorithm.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Information Service plays a very important role in Grid Computing Environment. Through information Service Grid applications are able to exploit the knowledge about current grid status and configuration to adapt themselves to changes in heterogeneous, dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a framework of Information Service based on the testbed ShanghaiGrid. In GT3, the Index Service in MDS can not provide a reliable indexing, while in our framework, using the notification method to contact Grid Services to Index Service to provide a reliable indexing. The information that Information Service should provide according with the ShanghaiGrid is discussed in detail.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

But there are still many problems waiting to be solved for workflow. One of these problems is the poor adaptability of workflow. This paper intends to enhance the adaptability from the view of supporting dynamic process change. In the paper, a workflow model that is fit for dynamic change is defined and the verification rules are firstly set up for this model. Specifically, our method is based on the concept of executable path of workflow. Based on the executable path, the concepts and algorithms of valid process and complete sub-process are introduced to solve the problems brought by process model dynamic change.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

By using the workflow, users in GCE would compose several Grid services as a new Service and provide it to others. This will enlarge the extensibility and business-originated usage in the GCE.

10040,WebPeer: A P2P-based System for Publishing and Discovering Web Services.,"The use of Web Services as an infrastructure of service sharing has made it possible to provide collaboration and interoperability in distributed computing environment. In this environment, service publishing and discovery are required as elementary functionalities for users to be able to locate the shared resources. The mechanism of service publishing and discovery with centralized architecture restricts the reliability and scalability of the distributed computing environment as the services and resources on the web are fast emerging. The peer-to-peer (P2P) systems and applications, on the other hand, employ distributed resources to perform critical functions in a decentralized manner. This paper introduces Web Services Oriented Peer-to-peer (WSOP) architecture with a combination of centralized and decentralized characteristics, and presents a framework of service publishing and discovery model based on WSOP architecture. The prototype system - WebPeer implemented based on this model demonstrates the WSOP architecture can not only help to overcome the known obstacles in common Web Services infrastructure such as single node failure, but also extend the ability of the pure P2P systems, such as more efficiently locating the resources, increasing the interoperability between different P2P systems.

Most existing wireless P2P applications concern merely the sharing of a variety of contents. For magnifying the extent of the sharing in wireless P2P (WP2P) environment, this paper presents a P2P mobile service sharing infrastructure that empowers an autonomous peer to propel distributed problem solving (e.g., in the travel domain) through service sharing and execution in an intelligent way.

Also, we present a novel technique for discovering semantic relations between pre and post-conditions of different services using their ontological descriptions. This enables determining services with complimentary functions and generating a semantic Web of services. Our technique takes semantic similarity of pre and post-conditions into account and builds on our earlier work on discovering semantic relationships between interfaces (input and output) of Web services.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

A framework of a tree-based Grid Information Service (TGIS) is proposed in this paper. This framework is based on GTÂ¿s MDS. MDS uses centralized GIIS to index services. Performance study shows that GIIS can not sustain large users and GRIS. Our TGIS framework uses decentralized GIIS to solve that problem. We construct each GIIS node in a tree structure which can solve system performance and scalability issue.,2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10044,A New Method for Measuring the Bottleneck Bandwidth.,"Measuring the bottleneck bandwidth of a path is useful to many applications. The existing tools to measure the network bottleneck bandwidth are mostly based on the packet pair technique. But the intrinsic error exists in packet pair technique due to the effect of the data link layer, and the incorrect results obtained by the filter algorithm when the network load is heavy. To resolve these problems, we put forward a new technique called packet tetrad. Because of the differentiate relation between the two packet pairs in a packet tetrad, the disturbance of the data link layer may be eliminated. So the packet tetrad technique has the high accuracy on measurement. The results of simulating measurements under ns-2 environment show that the packet tetrad mode has more robustness than the packet pair technique had.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Using the idle cycles donated by the clusters scattered over the Internet, data-intensive biologic applications in the field of drug discovery can be computed in this computing system. Clusters that donate idle cycles are organized in Peer-to-Peer overlay networks to eliminate problems caused by traditional client-server model.

10047,Matchmaking for Semantic Web Services.,"The most important topic about the web recently is semantic web services. The current trend of the software development is to reduce the development time, but at the same time increase the functionality, reusability and stability of the building block without worrying about how the service is implemented. As the number of services available on the web increases, the difficulty for both the service requester and provider to look for the most suitable potential counterpart will also increase. Matchmaking therefore is an important aspect of the web interactions, which enable both service requester and provider trim down the amount of time to meet the most suitable potential counterpart. In this paper we describe how to blend the matchmaking algorithm to the typical web service architecture.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The outcomes of the trust decisions can then be employed by the Grid security system to formulate trust enhanced security solutions. We design several algorithms to demonstrate how one can derive the trust enhanced security solutions for both user and resource provider protection with the proposed trust management architecture. Leveraging on trust knowledge and forming it as part of the security decisions, the proposed architecture possesses several desirable emerging properties that enable it to provide an improved level of security for Grid computing systems.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Components - distributed, black-box, processing elements - may have distinct communication styles. Services can be used to augment the interaction of components to deliver on a common task. Unfortunately, there exist scenarios where components and services do not interact congenially. At issue is the service design that, even with standards in place, may ignore important aspects of component communication expectations. Thus, a complete integration is not achieved without implementing ad hoc glue code external to the design strategy. Introducing glue code, without design traceability, limits control, dynamism, and upgrades to components and services. We specify templates for framing glue code as integration completion functions (ICFs). Uniform designs are given using multiple modeling techniques to foster compilation of an ICF repository, where their instantiation can be plug-ins to application integrations.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Available tools such as cybernotary will generate evidence when one requests. In reality, no one realize to do so, until the dispute occurs. So, a few people keep the evidence while the business occurs. This paper proposes the Automatic E-evidence Generation System that collects information passed through the internet proactively. E-evidence is generated at a specific time that allows one who needs it for a later use to solve dispute. A trusted third party is an important mechanism to intercept web pages between a web server and browser. However, generating evidence proactively may cause information overload.

We propose a fully decentralized computing model, considering all participant as peers that can submit personalized computing tasks to any number of other peers currently offering their services, listed in a peer directory. Our model is built upon Chord, a particular Distributed Hash Table. Chord allows load balancing of the number of keys per node, but offers no way to balance the bandwidth load of a frequently accessed key, such as a peer directory.

An SOA-based application typically composes various distributed functions, including some possibly provided by external parties such as independent businesses. The key advantage of SOAs is the resulting dynamism, since the composed parts can be readily swapped out in favor of others of like functionality. SOA environments thus reflect the dynamism of human socioeconomic environments where businesses interact, collaborate, and expose services to each other in order to jointly create value.

Following those mechanisms, an agent-based selective information retrieval on the base of topical crawling, high-performance indexing and efficient search algorithm is implemented.

10092,Efficient Integration of Fine-grained Access Control in Large-scale Grid Services.,"In this paper, we present a scalable authorization service, based on the concept of fine-grained access control (FGAC), for large-scale Grid infrastructures that span multiple independent domains. FGAC enables participating resource owners to specify fine-grained policies concerning which user can access can their resources under which mode. We argue that such an authorization service must be integrated with the resource broker service to avoid scheduling requests onto resources which do not authorize the user request. For this reason, we develop a novel resource broker service that integrates access control with resource scheduling. In our system, both resource owners and users define their resource access and usage policies. The resource broker schedules a user request only within the set of resources whose policies match the user credentials (and vice-versa). Since this process of evaluating authorization policies of resources and user, in addition to checking the resource requirement, can be a potential bottleneck for a large scale Grid, we also analyze the problem of efficient evaluation of FGAC policies. In this context, we present a novel method for policy organization and compare its performance with other strategies. Preliminary results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance performance.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In addition, the paradigm of service-oriented architectures allows a composition of applications based on distributed web services. By using registries it becomes possible to choose the appropriate services at runtime. It needs to be considered that services for mobile use may have different scopes. For instance, routing or weather services may be dedicated to a specific region so that they may be useless if a userÂ¿s area of interest does not match the serviceÂ¿s scope. It is hence necessary to identify and use those services with a scope that corresponds to the relevant context such as a userÂ¿s location. Moreover, if the context changes, it is desirable to automatically switch between different equivalent service instances to provide a user with a continuous connection to a desired service. We denote this mechanism as service roaming. This paper presents the major concepts needed for service roaming as well as a roaming model based on n-dimensional context spaces.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Among all valuable information business process, current business process management systems only reuse the workflow model, which is of a relatively lower level, and cannot fully support process unit composition. This paper suggests that business process should be regarded as a kind of knowledge, and reuse of this knowledge should cover a much wider range. A business knowledge reuse framework is discussed.

10105,Service retrieval based on behavioral speci.cation.,"The capability to easily find useful services (software applications, software components, scientific computations) becomes increasingly critical in several fields. Current approaches for components retrieval are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs. To go beyond the limits of these approaches, a substantial effort has been done by different works on semantic web and ontologies by exploiting more knowledge on the semantics of the components. However, this effort still remains insufficient and does not ful?ll user needs as many functional or quality aspects are hidden within the specification of components behavior. In this paper we argue that, in many situations, the component discovery process should be based on the specification of this behavior, that is the process model which describes each component. The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on process models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. To do so, we reduce the problem of service behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and we adapt existing algorithms for this purpose.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The scheduler operates by sampling the resource consumption of processes and limiting which processes are eligible for scheduling by the kernel. We present a Unix implementation of this framework and show that it can accurately control the rate of execution of compute-bound processes, with low computational overhead, despite its user-level operation.

However, certain technical concerns relating to reliable interactions among hosts in ad hoc networks have not yet received much attention. We introduce follow-me sessions, where interactions occur between a client and a service, rather than a specific provider or server. We allow the client to switch service providers, if needed. We exploit strategies involving the use of contextual information, strong process migration, context-sensitive binding, and locationagnostic communication protocols. We show how follow-me sessions mitigate issues related to proxy-based service-oriented architectures in ad hoc networks.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10117,An Open Standard Description Language for Semantic Grid Services Assembly for Autonomic Computing Overlay.,"Over the coming years, many are anticipating grid computing infrastructure, utilities and services to become an integral part of future socio-economical fabric. However, factors such as; cost of access, reliability and dependability of the technology will undoubtedly influence its adoption and widespread. Though, IBM between the many are promoting autonomic computing as a solution to alleviate such concerns by delegating software systems' own management, security, reliability and performance tuning to the software itself. Based on an on-going research work, focusing on high-assurance concerns of widely distributed systems, this paper will outline a service-oriented approach and associated service infrastructure description languages, which are used to facilitate the construction and management of ad-hoc federated software services.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10118,A Framework for Failure Impact Analysis and Recovery with Respect to Service Level Agreements.,"In todayÂ¿s IT service market customers urge providers to grant guarantees for quality of service (QoS) which are laid down in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). To satisfy customers and to avoid penalties, service providers have to ensure that the agreed SLAs are met. Therefore, it is necessary to be able to effectively deal with resource failures which could endanger the SLAs by affecting the provided services. The effort for recovering from failures should be selected corresponding to the expected SLA violation costs. In this paper we present a framework to automatically determine the impact of resource failures with respect to services and service level agreements. We achieve this by monitoring the service quality from inside and outside the service provider and also by incorporating information about the current and expected future service usage. The expected costs of the resource failures are assessed to select an appropriate recovery alternative. Besides this short term perspective the impact analysis can also be employed to identify critical resources and to improve the service provisioning.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10119,Grid-Based Decision Support with Pro-Active Mobile Computing.,"With the emergence of Grid computing and service-oriented architectures, computing is becoming increasingly less confined to traditional computing platforms. Grid computing promises the accessibility of vast computing and data resources across geographically dispersed areas. This capability is significantly enhanced by establishing support for mobile wireless devices to deliver access to high-performance computing under demanding circumstances. Access to the Grid from mobile devices can be very effective in business environments where users can access the vast computing power and data repositories on the Grid while working out on the field. This also enables and encourages collaborative working environments. A Grid demonstrator system for distributed aircraft health monitoring already developed and implemented in the UK E-Science Grid project, DAME, is introduced. In this demonstrator, CBR technology for decision support is implemented in a practical framework that enables Grid-based, proactive mobile computing.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

By global analysis, we extract keywords from the whole document to reflect the user's research preference. While in the local analysis step, we disambiguate query by extracting keywords from the text that is around the marked query. We use these keywords to reflect the query's context information and suggest interactive query expansion finally.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10121,Implementation of Business Processes in Service-Oriented Systems.,Service-oriented software systems (SOSS) are becoming the leading edge of software engineering. SOSS are virtual peer-to-peer networks of autonomous software components behaving like the services in real world mass service systems. As such service-oriented systems have no inherent tool to support business processes. The paper proposes an implementation of business processes in SOSS. The implementation can be improved if data stores can be integrated into SOSS and used together with the classical message passing. It indicates that service orientation is based on a paradigm different from the object-oriented one.,2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10125,Queueing Network-based Optimisation Techniques for Workload Allocation in Clusters of Computers.,"This paper addresses workload allocation techniques for clusters of computers. The workload in question is homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogeneous workload contains only QoS-demanding jobs (QDJ) or non-QoS jobs (NQJ) while heterogeneous workload is a mix of QDJs and NQJs. The processing platform used is a single cluster or multiple clusters of computers. Two workload allocation strategies (called ORT and OMR) are developed for homogeneous workloads by establishing and numerically solving optimisation equation sets. The ORT strategy achieves the Optimised mean Response Time for homogeneous NQJ workload; while the OMR strategy achieves the Optimised mean Miss Rate for homogeneous QDJ workload. Based on ORT and OMR, a heterogeneous workload allocation strategy is developed to dynamically partition the clusters into two parts. Each part is managed by ORT or OMR to exclusively process NQJs or QDJs. The judicial partitioning achieves an optimised comprehensive performance, which combines the mean response time and the mean miss rate. The effectiveness of these workload allocation techniques is demonstrated through queueing-theoretical analysis as well as through experimental studies. These techniques can be applied to e-business workload management to improve the distribution of different types of requests in clusters of servers.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

We describe how we compose the state information based on the formalized sequence of the interactions. We also describe how the shared service instance is managed, and interacted with, through standard Web services interfaces.

In CROWN, Information Service is the kernel part which handles resource discovery and management process. Employing existing information service architectures suffers from poor scalability, long search response time, and large traffic overhead. In this paper, we propose a service club mechanism, called S-Club, for efficient service discovery. In S-Club, an overlay based on existing GIS mesh network of CROWN is built, so that GISs are organized as service clubs. Each club serves for a certain type of service while each GIS may join one or more clubs. Performance of S-Club is evaluated by comprehensive simulations. Simulation results show that S-Club scheme significantly improves search performance and outperforms existing approaches.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10131,Job Scheduling of Savant for Grid Computing on RFID EPC Network.,"In the Grid computing environment, there are a lot of important issues, including information service, information security, resource management, routing, fault tolerance, and so on. Among the issues, the job scheduling is a major problem since it is a fundamental and crucial step in achieving the high performance. The job scheduling problem has been known as a combinatorial optimization problem. Scheduling in a Grid environment can be seen as an extension to the scheduling problem on local parallel systems. In the research, we focus on applying the technologies of RFID and Grid computing to the architecture of EPC network. In the view of EPC network, there are a lot of applications needing computing power of Grid to solve huge quantity of coming EPC data. According to the architecture of EPC network and the environment of Grid computing, they have several places homologous characteristics with each other. Therefore, we propose a new algorithm that modifies the traditional GA and integrates SA. Since the processes of GA and SA keep no memory, some problemÂ¿s status visited before may be visited again. In order to overcome the drawback, we design a learning scheme to remember visited statues to reduce the probability of the re-visiting improvement the performance in the search space. It can help to find the optimal or Near-optimal scheduling efficiently and avoid the resource deadlock. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm, HGASA- with learning scheme, also considers about several properties of Grid computing environment and EPC network, such as heterogeneity, dynamic adaptation and the independent relationship of jobs.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

To actualize larger benefit from Grid by widening Grid adoption, the formation of trust relationship among participants is one of the most important components that should be concerned. While trust mechanisms among distributed nodes have been studied, the related works are rather theoretical and conceptual than applicable to practical commercial Grid. Based on this observation, we classify trust depending on distinctive requirements in practical Grid utilization, and improve the evaluation process of trust by suggesting integrated measuring methods. We also introduce the ways for practical use of evaluated trust by guaranteeing individualsÂ¿ manageability. Finally, we describe the process for eliciting system constituentsÂ¿ trust requirements and validating suggested architecture, which will be conducted in the next phase of this research.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Existing work, based on database technologies, assumes a known set of sensors, deployed for a specific application, intended for a group of users who are aware of the application. In contrast, our work provides a new environment for publishing real-time sensor data, and sharing sensor-based applications with unsolicited users over the Internet. Providers register their sensors with a UDDI registry where any user can discover them over the Internet. Once the desired sensors are located, the user can employ two new communication protocols, namely SSCP and SSTP, to control the incoming sensor streams. As the data arrive at the user browser software, a corresponding plug-in such as a data animation module is activated to allow the user to ""see"" the data stream presented in an intelligible way.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In addition, agents encapsulating contents/services can contain other agents in themselves (synthesis of agents). A mobile agent compound integrating multiple contents/services can be thus dynamically formed, in which multiple agents work cooperatively and migrate together as a unit.

10142,Coordination & Enterprise Wide P2P Computing.,"Peer-to-Peer (P2P) computing is a distributed computing paradigm that uses large numbers of autonomous hosts as a platform for the execution of applications. This paper focuses on P2P computing in an enterprise environment. Unlike other P2P computing scenarios more access and data about the peers, network and users is available thus enabling the deployment of more complex applications that consists of components that are hosted on different peers. Unfortunately the distribution of components in a P2P network leads to serious coordination issues. This paper has two aims. First of all it is an attempt to draw more attention to the issues surrounding the use of P2P computing in an enterprise environment. We believe that there is a growing demand for using the distributed resources of an organization in a P2P manner that allows users to keep their autonomy and control over ""their"" machines.

More and more logistics companies find other Web service providers to integrate their application in order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. Web service meets their requirement. Web services are self-contained, web-enabled applications capable not only of performing business activities on their own, but also possessing the ability to engage other Web services in order to complete higher-order business transactions. As the main functional part of logistics system, freight transportation system assumes the job of scheduling vehicles for the logistics system to complete the transportation task. In this paper a freight transportation system which is separated from the logistics system is a typical business case. The prototype system developed on J2EE has a quality of cross-platform and interoperability with other systems.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10145,Satisfying Database Service Level Agreements while Minimizing Cost through Storage QoS.,"The emerging paradigms of service oriented architectures and utility-based computing have the potential greatly reduce the cost of data management. Data management service providers negotiate with their customers agree on a service level agreement (SLA) that guarantees performance and reliability. However, these providers have the freedom to cut costs by taking advantage of economies of scale across multiple customers. In this paper, we examine the problem of choosing a QoS level for each table or index in a service providerÂ¿s backend databases so as to minimize the dollar cost of provisioning storage while satisfying application-level SLAs. This problem is difficult because changes in the access cost of different portions of the database can cause the database to alter its access patterns. We develop an algorithm that optimizes the choice of query execution plans and storage layout simultaneously to meet an SLA at minimum cost. In our experiments we use a part of the TPC-H benchmark as the workload and several models of the incremental cost of placing a volume at a high quality of service. Our results show that significant cost savings are possible through selective use of high storage QoS levels.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10146,Services and Autonomic Computing: A Practical Approach for Designing Manageability.,"IBM defines autonomic computing as Â¿an approach to build computing systems that are self-managed and operate with a minimum of human interference.Â¿ To build an autonomic system, some characteristics such as selfknowledge, self-optimization, self-healing, self-defense, among others, have to be built into it. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural paradigm that promotes development of software systems as sets of collaborative and loosely coupled services. It defines principals for achieving service interoperability, agility, reusability, integration and such others across heterogeneous distributed software systems. It is widely accepted that web services are entities that provide many out-of-the-box capabilities for building Service Oriented software systems. Since the SOA approach has been proposed recently, various standards for addressing areas such as service orchestration, security, contract definition languages, policy exchange mechanisms and such others, are presently under development. One such key area that is gaining a lot of attention recently is web service manageability. This paper discusses an approach for modeling the manageability of a web service at design time and implementing that model to impart autonomic capabilities to it at run time. Of the various characteristics of autonomic systems self-knowledge, self-recovery and selfoptimization are discussed herein.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In order to solve this issue, we have been developing a sort of agent-based coordination framework, called ""location-mediated web service coordination,"" that orchestrates Web Services wrapped in the agents.

10148,Performance Problems of Large Operational Systems Based on Web Services and a Solution.,"Large monolithic business systems, as for example the business suite Mysap from SAP, are increasingly restructured in system architectures with fine-granular components, which are loosely coupled by Web services. Their intra-system collaboration has usually no need for dynamic discovery with UDDI. Those architectures show many advantages, but cause also a performance problem which might become an inhibitor to their use in operational systems. We experienced that problem with I^3 M, an instant messaging system we developed and present as an example. Measurements with I^3 M show that the performance overhead of Web service invocation among collocated system components may decrease the system performance dramatically. We propose a solution to the performance problem that preserves the benefits of Web service invocations, but provides the performance of ""normal"" component invocations.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Service discovery at the present time is based primarily on keywords, or interfaces of web services through the use of ontology. We argue that ""behavior signatures"" as operational level description should play an important role in the service discovery process. In this paper, we propose a new behavior model for web services using automata and logic formalisms. Roughly, the model associates messages with activities and adopts the IOPR model in OWL-S to describe activities. A new query language is developed to express temporal and semantic properties on service behaviors. Query evaluation algorithms are developed; in particular, an optimization approach using RE-tree and heuristics is shown to improve the performance. Speci?cally, experimental results show that the use of RE-tree reduces query evaluation time by an order of magnitude and with heuristics it enhances the performance by two orders of magnitude. This is clearly an encouraging starting point.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10153,From BPEL4WS to OWL-S: Integrating E-Business Process Descriptions.,"With the rapid deployment of e-services, many workflow-like e-business process definition languages come into existence. At the same time, Ontology Web Language for Services (OWL-S) aims to build an ontology language to support the integration of various specifications. There has been some work on mapping WSDL (Web Services Description Language) to OWL-S to build a connection between the Web service and service profile. However, in the sense of activity relationships, there has been no effort so far trying to build the OWL-S service model from a workflow process model. Therefore, we design and develop an innovative mapping tool to translate BPEL4WS (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services) to OWL-S. Through this mapping, semantics in the traditional business process specifications can be enriched significantly to enable more flexible and automatic e-service functions by using existing OWL-S tools such as composition and discovery, especially the execution of workflow-based services.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

It is widely recognised that to form and manage a VO effectively, the ability to gauge quality of service (QoS) is important. Existing methods for managing QoS in SOC environments tend to adopt a provider-centric perspective, aiming largely at optimising and guaranteeing QoS for service delivery.

10159,Replicating Web Applications On-Demand.,"Many Web-based commercial services deliver their content using Web applications that generate pages dynamically based on user profiles, request parameters etc. The workload of these applications are often characterized by a large number of unique requests and a significant fraction of data updates. Hosting these applications drives the need for systems that replicates both the application code and its underlying data. We propose the design of such a system that is based on on-demand replication, where data units are replicated only to servers that access them often. This reduces the consistency overhead as updates are sent to a reduced number of servers. The proposed system allows complete replication transparency to the application, thereby allowing developers to build applications unaware of the underlying data replication. We show that the proposed techniques can reduce the client response time by a factor of 5 in comparison to existing techniques for a real-world e-commerce application used in the TPC-W benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate our strategies for a wide range of workloads and show that on-demand replication performs better than centralized and fully replicated systems by reducing the average latency of read/write data accesses as well as the amount of bandwidth utilized to maintain data consistency.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In this paper we decsribe a framework fro structured and programmatic dependency management among services written in the Java programming language. The framewrok's interface allows for defining an acrylic graph of dependencies. The graph's structure reflects the startup sequence of managed services. Upon services failure or international termination, the dependencies are consulted to determine which services may be affected. If the dependencies so dictate, a service that has gone off-line will automatically be restarted. The requisite changes, e.g., restarting, will be propagated along the graph's edge to ensure that the required dependencies are satisfied for each services.

In a developing country like India, this activity is influenced by local, socio-economic and cultural characteristics. Evaluating the business processes at regional or national scale therefore, reveals diversity in products, terminology, and process to carry out a complete business activity. While other complex but well-defined business processes are experiencing benefits of services driven e-business; Â¿marketing of agricultural produceÂ¿ has remained untouched by this revolution. Government of India is now planning to implement agricultural marketing reforms to streamline the process in all markets throughout the nation. Yet unavailability of proper underlying IT infrastructure will continue to inhibit the implementation and penetration of such technological advancements amongst the users. In absence of such capability, the informal transactions provide meager benefits to a farmer who looses a better price in other potential market, or a wholesaler, who might have got the desired quality product at a lower cost directly from the farm. There is a need to develop affordable and reliable solution that links all the actors involved in the system and provide an environment for a competitive business. This research paper demonstrates Web Services based business process management system, developed to aid marketing of agricultural produce. For achieving relevance to real-life practice, we carefully follow the business process suggested in model act that is planned for implementation in all the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) throughout India.

10169,A Reconfigurable QoS Monitoring Framework For Professional Short Message Services in GSM Networks.,"In mobile environments, packet transmission services suffer from packet losses due to e.g. inadequate received signal quality, or forced by protocols in the signaling domain of the infrastructure of a mobile communications network. To reduce the occurrence of packet losses and, hence, to improve the quality of packet transmission services, such as e.g. the Short Message Service (SMS) deployed in GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) based mobile communications networks, a quantitative analysis of the Quality of Service (QoS) in the signaling domain is mandatory. For this reason, appropriate QoS parameters are needed. In this communication, the authors propose such QoS parameters and apply them to the SMS in GSM networks. Furthermore, a system framework for QoS monitoring, alerting and reconfiguring an SMS Center is presented. It operates near real-time and, therefore, helps to maintain a high QoS level. Selected monitoring results gathered during real world network operation are presented.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10174,Trust2: Developing Trust in Peer-to-Peer Environments.,"In peer-to-peer (P2P) environments, a peer needs to interact with unknown peers for the services provided. This requires the trust evaluation prior to and posterior to interactions. This paper presents Trust2: a novel and dynamic peer trust evaluation model, which aims to measure the credibility of peersÂ¿ recommendations, and thus to filter noise in responses and obtain more accurate and objective trust values. In our model, prior to any interaction, the trust value results from the evaluations given by other peers. Posterior to interactions, the trust values results from both other peersÂ¿ evaluations and the requesting peerÂ¿s experience. In the aggregation of trust evaluations, the weight to the requesting peer becomes higher and higher. Meanwhile, during this process, the credibility of each responding peerÂ¿s recommendation can be measured round by round. This leads to the filtering of low credibility peers and the improvement of trust evaluations.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The paper concludes that the benchmark represents an unbiased subset of actual scenarios because the ranking and performance patterns of the leading Web services frameworks used in the experiment are consistent with Industry wide experiences. Additionally the paper introduces a performance model to analyze Web service frameworks and identifies complexity of the SOAP messages and size of the payloads they carry as two major factors that affect the RTT of the SOAP messages and reveals that a framework that is good at handling complex SOAP messages may not deal with messages that carry larger payloads equally well.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10182,A Role based Access Control for Web Services.,"Web services are vulnerable to various types of security attacks. This paper addresses one type of attacks, where applications trying to access services to which they are not authorized. Existing access control for web services lack of support for global services. As such services are WAN-based, therefore access control needed to deal with various levels of web services, including global (for composite services) and local level (for web servers). This paper proposes two access control: SWS-RBAC (for single services) and CWS-RBAC (for global services). Instead of protecting the content of the service's parameters, these models protect the parameters themselves. The proposed approach introduces global roles which are used in the mapping to local roles of other service providers. To maintain the autonomy of roles between providers, an efficient role-mapping mechanism has been proposed accordingly.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

We demonstrate the features of SOAR through a DealMaker service that helps buyers and sellers semi-automate the various steps in a real-estate transaction. This service is a composed service, with message-based interactions specified in SSDL, the SOAP service description language. The implemented embedded trust and security solution deals with the usual privacy and authorization issues, but also establishes trust in ownership and other claims of participants. We also demonstrate how formal techniques can proof correctness of the service interaction protocol specified in SSDL.

While current SWS approaches have shown some early promising results, they have focused on somewhat unrealistic use-cases that make various problematic assumptions and focus on somewhat farfetched usage scenarios. In this paper we present a category of use case scenarios for SWSs that centers around keeping human users in the automation process while facilitating their activities.

In this paper we propose a rule driven approach for adaptive business collaboration development in which rules drive and govern the development process. We firstly introduce the Business Collaboration Context Framework (BCCF), which provides enterprizes with the context required for business collaboration. We then explain our model driven approach with which enterprises can capture this context in business collaboration models.

10193,Knowledge as a Service and Knowledge Breaching.,"In this paper, we introduce and explore a new computing paradigm we call knowledge as a service, in which a knowledge service provider, via its knowledge server, answers queries presented by some knowledge consumers. The knowledge serverÂ¿s answers are based on knowledge models that may be expensive or impossible to obtain for the knowledge consumers.While this new paradigm of computing is promising, we must establish a solid foundation to ensure its utility. We focus on the security aspect of the paradigm, and particularly on the problem we call knowledge breaching attack, which may allow an adversary to recover the knowledge underlying a knowledge service. Without being able to adequately handling such an attack, the knowledge service providers would never have any economic incentives to develop such a paradigm. Unfortunately, this paper theoretically shows that any interesting knowledge is subject to the knowledge breaching attack, and empirically shows that some knowledge models could be breached after a very small number of queries (e.g., 0.2- 1% portion of the domain). Thus we need to investigate technical means that can alleviate such powerful attacks (at least for most practical knowledge models).",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

We observe that the velocity representation of mobile nodes provides a characterization of the mobility groups. We attempt to predict the future availability of wireless links based on group mobility model. Intuitively, mobile peers within the same group tend to have a high probability of keeping stable interconnection topology. We use the velocity-group model which helps us predict the future availability of wireless links and leads to fast amplifying the system's total streaming capacity using its self-growing. The extensive simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed model in mobile peer-to-peer media streaming system.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

However, these handheld applications can be quite slow and often lack important functionality compared to their desktop counterparts.We have developed PASSPORT, (PDA Application Streaming Service PORTal) a thin-client solution that leverages more powerful servers to run full-function desktop applications and then simply stream screen updates to the PDA for display. PASSPORT uses server-side screen scaling to provide high-fidelity display and seamless mobility across a broad range of different clients and screen sizes, including both portrait and landscape viewing modes.

When requiring a service, users may specify additional information which is of two types: QoSs (i.e., the print resolution or the transmission bandwidth) and properties (i.e., the location of the resource that provides the service or the provider of the service). In the adaptivity process, both types of information are mapped on the QoSs and properties of the underlying system's resources, which are explicitly represented through architectural reflection. As a consequence, resources try to adapt their QoSs to those required by the current service.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Because of distributed responsibilities, ownership, and control, often, it is not feasible to acquire all information needed for the service composition, thus there might be no guarantee that the service execution has an anticipated effect.

So a new scheme that is called End System Multicast or Overlay Multicast for group communication has been emerged. It supports IP Multicast functions, which is located on application level. For developing it, we have been focused on efficient overlay tree construction among group members with low stretch and stress. However, we should consider a variety of transmission or receipt condition since a real internet environment has users with various transmission/receipt rates. Thus, we make on-demand one-time source specific tree depending on required bandwidth information of group members when a member requests data transmission. Our mechanism provides satisfied data quality limited maximum transmission rate of the source to each group members. Furthermore, we manage a large group enough as distributing control information to cores that are designated members for maintaining host member information. Lastly, we prove that our tree guarantees data quality to each group members, and show low tree construction time is required. In addition, for evaluating group scalability, we analyze control information increasing rate via group size, and validate its scalability.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10208,Enterprise Service Oriented Architecture (ESOA) Adoption Reference.,"In response to current pursue of achieving business agility and technology flexibility through SOA, this presentation provides insight and discussion regarding to what SOA is, what it really means to an enterprise, where it is right now, where it is leading to, how to practice it, the expected benefits, and how to calculate associated ROI. It includes discussion in SOA concepts, technologies, and best practices based on practice experience, survey from public sources, as well as initial ideas and contributions. SOA enables agile businesses through composable business processes and services that will be supported by flexible and composable IT services. The commonly accepted standards will ensure interoperability, shareability, and reusability. SOA can be applied to the full spectrum of enterprise business and IT, which include business service specification, IT strategic planning, enterprise architecture, solution development, and business operation. Also, SOA can be considered as a practical modeling approach for enterprise architecture (EA) development. It can help to bridge EA with solution architecture and implementation by layered service descriptions across business modeling, application modeling, and technology implementation; so that it can help bring EA into reality. The ROI for SOA should consider the full spectrum of SOA benefits. A ROI reference matrix can be constructed based on the value proposition and IT strategic planning, which can provide guidance for iterative ROI assessment and performance measurement. The concept of SOA is not new, which can be traced back to the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). The recent popular component-based and service-oriented architecture has extended its scope to business domain, which is reflected in Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). Web Services enable the SOA concept being applied in web environment. The content in this presentation includes SOA conceptual model, federated SOA service infrastructure, enterprise SOA layers, SOA service life cycle, etc. The recommended SOA adoption steps are discussed in three stages: SOA initiation, SOA workgroup formation, and SOA practice. SOA initiation includes SOA planning, and establish baseline for cross organizational SOA adoptions. The SOA workgroup usually will be an extension of existing EA team, and will serve as the core for SOA practice. The SOA practice includes the development and documentation of strategic plan, governance, and approaches; the extension of enterprise architecture; the coordination of cross organizational SOA implementation; service institutionalization; service extension for enterprise external services; etc. This presentation discusses SOA in widely covered topics and popular concerns. It consists of the combination of SOA current state studies and solution recommendations in moving forward, which can be served as a foundation reference in SOA adoption for an enterprise.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The address uses the TCS framework for Services Computing as a backdrop - across services strategy, services implementation and most importantly services governance. This is a progressive approach towards bridging the gap between 'what IT delivers' and 'what the business wants' through a well defined 'value measurement framework.'

To increase the usability of a service discovery, the result list of services should be ordered with regard to the relevance of the services. Means of ordering a list of workflows due to their similarity with regard to a query are missing. This paper presents a pilot of an empirical study on the influence of different measures on workflow similarity. It turns out that, although preliminary, relations between different measures are indicated and that a similarity definition depends on the application scenario in which the service discovery is applied.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10215,Providing Data Transfer with QoS as Agreement-Based Service.,"Over the last decade, Grids have become a successful tool for providing distributed environments for secure and coordinated execution of applications. The successful deployment of many realistic applications in such environments on a large scale has motivated their use in experimental science [15, 5] where Grid-based computations are used to assist in ongoing experiments. In such scenarios, quality of service (QoS) guarantees on execution as well as data transfer are desirable. The recently proposed WS-Agreement model[16,6] provides an infrastructure within which such quality of service can be negotiated and obtained. We have designed and implemented a data transfer service that exposes an interface based on this model and defines agreements which guarantee that, within a certain confidence level, file transfer can be completed under a specified time. The data transfer service accepts a client's request for data transfer and makes an agreement with the client based on QoS metrics (such as the transfer time and confidence level with which the service can be provided). In our approach we use prediction as a base for formulating an agreement with the client, and we combine prediction and rate limiting to adaptively ensure that the agreement is met.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10216,The MIDAS System: A Service Oriented Architecture for Automated Supply Chain Management.,"The MIDAS system that we have developed is an automated supply chain management system based on the Service Oriented Architecture and Web Services. MIDAS provides a loosely-coupled distributed environment that allows customers, manufacturers, and suppliers to cooperate over the Internet and World Wide Web. It aims to reduce inventory carrying costs and logistics administration costs, yielding a more efficient supply chain, by supporting just-in-time manufacturing. It eliminates, or substantially reduces, human intervention on both the customer/manufacturer side and the manufacturer/supplier side. It allows a manufacturer to select, dynamically from the MIDAS Registry, suppliers of components, based on the price, availability, and delivery time of those components. A manufacturer can use one of several strategies to aggregate customers' orders before it processes them and to accumulate suppliers' quotes before it decides on a particular supplier. The use of a Service Oriented Architecture, such as MIDAS, can substantially improve the efficiency of a supply chain.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10217,Using Ontologies for Distributed Workflow Management.,"In workflow systems or other applications, users need more semantic information. Ontologies and semantic web are important technologies for managing semantic information. Our work is focused on semantic spatial information in distributed workflow.

Furthermore, workflow and user profile can help in predicting near future data needs and therefore can enable intelligent data charging.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10220,Modeling and Verifying Configuration in Service Deployment.,"When deploying a service, software systems required by the service should be configured correctly. However, since software has tens or hundreds of configuration parameters and the parameters of different software may have simple or complex, explicit or implicit dependencies and constraints, to configure multiple software systems in service deployment becomes a difficult, error-prone and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a model based approach to automated configuration. Motivated by two real cases found in IBM software products and solutions, our approach has three contributions. Firstly, a meta-model of configuration, called software resource configuration model, is defined for integrating configuration parameters and experiences of different software into a global model. Secondly, a set of configuration rules are designed for verifying incorrect configuration that violates constraints specified by service deployment engineers. Thirdly, a supporting tool, called Comfort, is implemented and evaluated by the motivating cases.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

However, it is not clear that this new model of Web services provides any measurable increase in computing trustworthiness. In this paper we propose a generic framework to control the trustworthiness of computing in the domain of Web services. A layered model is established to highlight four key elements: resources, policies, validation processes, and management. The robustness of this model exhibits its flexibility and extensibility. Examples utilizing our framework are reported.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

QoS is a major factor that affects the choice of a pricing scheme for a given network. In this paper, we explore a pricing scheme that uses service profiles, which define the QoS received from accessing a common resource pool. Through resource sharing between the profiles, maximisation of network resource utilisation is achieved. In this paper, the mathematical model of the proposed pricing scheme is presented, together with QoS evaluation results.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Transformation is an effective way to bridge the gap between business level analysis and IT solutions. We present algorithms that transform business process models based on these two paradigms into IT solutions of web service platform. The specific problems we addressed in this transformation are: 1) how to generate the implementation code of an optimal size; 2) how to preserve the natural structure of business process models in the generated code.",2005,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10226,A safety criterion for reusing a business process in the desired integrated.,"Enterprises are witnessing increased thrust on collaboration and integration of existing applications to provide value-added services across the entire supply chain. Traditionally, enterprise applications are built as point solutions with context-specific built-in assumptions hard-coded in their implementation. Enterprise Application Integration discipline deals with the mechanism for integrating such isolated applications into a consistent whole. By modeling an enterprise application as a 3-tuple comprising of its data, service and process models, EAI problem can be visualized as view-integration problem over data, service and process models. This paper presents a pragmatic approach to analyze the process model of an existing application with respect the process model of desired application to identify and mitigate the conflicts in the built-in assumptions of two process models. A formal technique to analyze the process model at various levels of granularities and a set of operators to mitigate the conflicts are proposed. The proposed approach maximizes the reusability in the context of EAI.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The main rationale behind the work presented here is that the service management component should be designed in such as a way that life cycle aspects should emerge from within service management components themselves as an integral part of overall services management. The features of context-aware applications and services should be reflected in life cycle management. Furthermore, standard practices of the mobile network industry must be taken into account for any serious effort to deal with this issue. All these aspects have guided and provided impetus for the work presented. Therefore this work is easily applicable in industry applications and proposes a clear-cut association between requirements and interfaces.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In the agent society environment, we discuss both inter-society and intra-society ontology mapping method, and finally introduce the architecture of prototype system for ontology mapping in agent society. We also use user participation to improve our mapping quality. Our research is based on agent society environment, mainly focusing on interoperability between societies and interaction in society. Based on our research and analysis, we intend to do some works for future research activities.",2004,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10234,The First Step of Introducing Risk Management for Prepossessing SLAs.,"Using Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is a central concept for the Grid commercialization since customers require guarantees for a successful job execution. However, agreeing on SLAs is a business risk for resource providers: system failures can lead to paying tremendous penalties. Accordingly, resource providers require an estimation about the risk of agreeing on an SLA. Furthermore, risks can be published and integrated into the negotiations as an additional SLA parameter. Each offer is linked with a possible execution on a specific resource since the risk of failure depends especially on the resource's stability. Therewith making reservations is the initial step for integrating risk management into the Grid. This paper describes the necessary workflow and measurements for selecting a resource according to assessed risks. A global perspective is presented in order to afford user-specific configurations. Concrete examples for several measurements present one possibility for rating and the important input factors.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10235,How Clustering Enterprise Architectures helps to Design Service Oriented Architectures.,"The main target of IT architects being responsible for complex and heterogeneous IT architectures is to align IT to business needs at the lowest costs possible. A recent approach to this issue are Service Oriented Architectures (SOA). In order to design and deploy a SOA methodological and technological aspects have to be taken into account. This contribution focuses on methodological aspects like how to find appropriate service domains and an appropriate granularity of the services. Therefore existing business processes, organizational structures and their linkage with the different elements of an organization's IT landscape will be analyzed. The paper presents a software system for automatically analyzing enterprise architectures incorporating clustering algorithms developed for analyzing community structures in a network oriented fashion. It will be shown, how clustering and visualization of enterprise architecture networks improve the understanding of underlying structures of enterprise architectures and thus lead to a better design of SOA.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

But there are still many problems associated with the effective use of geospatial data. One is that geospatial data is usually large in volume and is archived at geographically distributed data centers. Another is that the low-level geospatial data contains raw data instead of information that can be directly applied by users. In this paper, we discuss solutions to some of the problems based on the Grid and SOA technologies. Specifically, we propose an architecture that can effectively manage large volumes of distributed geospatial data, the concept of virtual geospatial data products, and a mechanism that supports on-demand productions of customized geospatial data products. A prototypical system based on the architecture and concept has been implemented and demonstrated.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

This paper addresses data quality assessment in business processes by proposing a modeling framework to quantify the data quality in an information processing system. We present a business process modeling framework for data quality analysis and develop the mathematical formulation for error propagation. This is overlaid with a business controls framework where the placement and effectiveness of the controls alter the propagation of errors. This framework enables the estimation and management of data quality when faced with changes in various aspects of the business process. It also allows the formulation of optimization problems that trade off the cost of business controls with the level or cost of the resultant data quality. We illustrate the modeling framework and analyses with a revenue management process.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10243,An Approach to Modeling Service-Oriented Development Process.,"To integrate heterogeneous distributed systems, there exist various researches and developments for the purpose of its adoption into enterprise environment. However, when service-oriented technologies are applied, it is difficult to adopt directly existing software system development methodologies, because of the primary elements of service-oriented architecture such as service provider, service requestor and service repository. In this paper, we define a conceptual model for developing systems in service-oriented computing. The model involves procedures and guidelines based on the Use Case model that is elicited from a business domain in requirement analysis. We focus on how to identify and how to determine key realization decisions for each service. The benefit of the identification method based on the Use Case model is that the service has reflected the business of the domain well and is in its proper granularity. The assessment guideline can help the settlement of a problem that is to determine the implementation strategy.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10244,A Distributed Service Management Infrastructure for Enterprise Data Centers Based on Peer-to-Peer Technology.,"This paper presents a distributed service management infrastructure called BISE. One distinguishing feature of BISE is its adoption of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model in support of realtime service managements. BISE offers significant advantages over existing systems in scalability, resilience, and manageability. Current P2P algorithms are mainly developed for the file-sharing applications running on desktops, which have characteristics dramatically different from enterprise data centers. This difference led us to design our own P2P algorithms specifically optimized for enterprise environments. Based on these algorithms, we implemented a P2P substrate called BiseWeaver (25,000 lines of Java code) as the core of BISE. Our evaluation on a set of distributed machines shows that BiseWeaver is efficient and robust, and provides timely monitoring data in support of proactive SLA management.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10245,Memory Servers: A Scope of SOA for High-End Computing.,"The expanding gap between microprocessor and disk performance has initiated new techniques of providing memory as a service in high-end computing (HEC). Although the processor and disk densities have improved over the last decades, the improvement of disk performance is inferior to that of processors, which is causing a bottleneck for HEC. With the rapid growth of network technology for cluster computers, the idea of accessing memory of an idle peer node has proven to be faster than accessing a disk. With this motivation, many researchers developed systems that offer idle memory as a service. In this paper, we present a brief survey of various systems that offer memory service in improving the disk access performance and discuss the scope of applying service oriented architecture (SOA) for HEC.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

One important aspect of processes that has been overlooked is their complexity. High complexity in processes may result in bad understandability, errors, defects, and exceptions leading processes to need more time to develop, test, and maintain. Therefore, excessive complexity should be avoided. This paper describes an experiment designed to validate the Control-Flow Complexity (CFC) metric that we have proposed in our previous work. In order to demonstrate that our CFC metric serves the purpose it was defined for, we have carried out an empirical validation by means of a controlled experiment.

The major contributions of this paper are the development of our context model and Context Aware Service Oriented Architecture (CA-SOA).

Based on the model, we have constructed CA-SOA for ubiquitous Web service discovery and access based on service and requesters' surrounding context.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10248,ITSGrid: A Novel Integrated Intelligent Transportation Information and Service Platform.,"With increasing demands of effective and efficient transportation from our society, the transportation issue has become a noticeable obstacle to the economic development for all countries and regions to a great extend. ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) technology is brought forward and considered as an effective approach that promises to alleviate many transportation problems such as traffic congestion, high accident rate, air pollution, and improve safety and reliability on existing roadway system. However, current ITS architectures do not give proper answers to some important problems in ITS such as how to integrate heterogeneous data on the semantic level, how to manage dynamic business process, how to cooperate ITS subsystems among different domains, how to communicate among traffic control center and road sensor network, etc. Hence, a fundamental shift in approach is needed to effectively resolve these complex problems.Fortunately, Grid technology, Semantic Web technology, Web Service technology, Messaging Oriented Middleware (MOM) technology bring us great chance to build a integrated platform for ITS to solve the beforementioned issues. Grid Computing is an ideal technology to realize resource sharing in distributed heterogeneity environments. Semantic Web offers a great opportunity to support data semantization based on a domain-specific ontology database. Process coordination based on Web Service gives a unified way to cooperate ITS subsystems among different organizations. Messaging Oriented Middleware enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled, reliable, and asynchronous in complex network environment.In this paper, we explore four technologies to build a novel Integrated Intelligent Transportation Information and Service Platform to realize traffic data semantization, traffic resource sharing, cooperation traffic process As a result, a key project for ITISP, ITSGrid, was started up by Zhejiang University and Hangzhou Enjoyor Electronics Co. Ltd in 2005. ITSGrid is an undergoing joint engineering project designed and developed by CCNT Lab in Zhejiang University and Enjoyor Electronics. The new features of ITSGrid are originated from two important research projects - DartGrid and DartFlow, and one key engineering project - JTang Application Server, in CCNT Lab. Its goal is to build intelligent transportation information and service platform, to integrate traffic data resources collected by Enjoyor and cooperate existing ITS subsystems and services deployed by Enjoyor, finally serve for transportation construction in China.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10250,Service Contract Template.,"Loose coupling is a cornerstone for Service- Oriented Architecture (SOA). Service contracts enable loose coupling, because they hide service-internal details from the outside world behind a facade. In the Web Services world, the service contract is commonly understood as a WSDL document possibly decorated with WS-Policy annotations. Such formal XML description is not immediately useful to business people. This paper proposes the notion of a service metadata document that contains human-readable business aspects of the service in addition to technical artifacts. Stakeholders at the business and technical level work collaboratively on the service metadata document and use it as a common framework for discussion. We see the service contract as a composition of functional metadata and a set of policies, such as security constraints, access restrictions for user groups, transport and service level agreements, charging, etc. For example, enterprises will often have different security requirements when a service is consumed from within the company than when it is consumed by an external business partner. The service lifecycle will be initiated by business people on the basis of a service contract template; the first step is a high-level description of the desired service characteristics. In an iterative process the document is then successively refined as it percolates from the management level to service architect and other stakeholders and as business requirements are tested against technical realities. Technical artifacts (WSDL, XSD, etc.) are added to the service contract and could be placed in a registry so that the service is visible to other departments or external partners. The clear distinction between service metadata and policies also helps maintaining a consistent model over runtime WSDL proliferation. Typically, policies are enforced by intermediaries, such as XML firewalls, enterprise service bus (ESB) or other WSinfrastructure. Each such intermediary offers a virtual service endpoint to the actual service implementation.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10251,Personalized Active Service Spaces for End-User Service Composition.,"End-user service composition is a promising way to ensure flexible, quick and personalized information provision and utilization, and consequently to better cope with spontaneous business requirements. For end-users to compose services directly, issues like service granularity, service organization and businesslevel semantics are critical. End-users will certainly be at loss if they have to select from a long list of available Web services expressed in IT jargons. This article introduces the concept of personalized active service spaces and focuses on the use of business services, service dependency rules, and service personalization rules to support end-user service composition. It addresses two key issues in end-user composition: how to utilize the user preference and context to restrict the scope of applicable services for selection, and how to capture and utilize dependencies or usage patterns between services in order to provide guidance and enforce temporal/sequential restrictions on service invocations for end-user service compositions.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

On the conceptual side, business process management helps model such applications. On the practical side, workflow systems help implement such systems. We propose the Navigation Plan concept for order processing. Business steps in order processing are mapped into Process Algebra and composed into Navigation Plans. On the practical side, Navigation Plans are directly executed in the RiverFish Architecture, thus guaranteeing the properties predicted by Process Algebra. Thus a well-defined order processing application is implemented into a reliable cooperative information system.

The design and implementation of data management system which is responsible for meeting these requirements in the ebusiness application is proposed in this paper. The developed prototype of this data management system, as a very important component of the service-oriented Manufacturing Grid (MGrid) project, provides one single logical view to multiple heterogeneous storage resources so that these resources can be used in a uniform way by higher level applications.

10260,Coupling RDF/RSS and WSRP for Dynamic Reusable Portlets: An Approach and a Use Case.,"The need for cost-effective platform independent means of application invocation has fuelled technologies like Web services. Web services technology has found its application in a number of interesting ways, one of them being in creation of universal interoperable remote portlets. Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) is a standard that allows aggregator applications to consume remote portlets based on Web services interfaces. XML vocabularies like RSS (Really Simple Syndication) or domain specific syndication syntactic frameworks allow for creation of raw data that can understood by a wide range of consuming portals and web sites. Usually individual aggregators consume these raw data feeds and render it in some required UI (User Interface) format. This approach requires that every single aggregator have a custom rendering application for generation of user specific UI, leading to considerable replication of effort. We take a wholistic view of the problem statement and propose an end to end architectural approach that combines usage of WSRP along with XML syndication feeds like RSS for creation of standards based, customizable, and dynamically generated reusable UI that can be consumed by aggregators like Portals.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10261,m3po: An Ontology to Relate Choreographies to Workflow Models.,"External business processes (choreography models) are currently disconnected from internal processes (workflow models), which leads to synchronisation and verification problems. Connecting these by directly mapping internal to external processes requires a quadratic amount of mappings; an intermediate ontology reduces the amount of necessary mappings but is not trivial to construct due to the variety in workflow meta-models. We introduce our multi meta-model process ontology ( m3po), which is based on various existing reference models and languages from the workflow and choreography domain. The m3po ontology relates workflow models to choreography models and allows choreography extraction from internal workflow models. An initial validation is given by translating an IBM Websphere MQ Workflow model into the m3po ontology and subsequently extracting an Abstract BPEL model from the ontology.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10262,Web Services based SOA for Next Generation Telecom Networks.,"Network operators are now on a journey towards a Next Generation Network (NGN) built on horizontal ""planes"", moving away from traditional vertical structure networks for fixed voice and data communication networks. IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is a part of wider network transformation to Next Generation (NG) Networks. The IMS core network has a common IP based transport plane and a common signalling or control plane, and it can be accessed by different access networks. IMS provides a control layer based on an end-to-end based Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that can control a session and remain agnostic of the access network. This innovation in the telecom industry where more intelligence is moving to the edge, can be closely linked to another innovation in the IT industry, where applications are being rendered as re-usable components, or services as we may refer to them. Such components, when made available on the web are referred to as Web Services. IBM's service enablement solution in the NGN space is based on three strategic tenets. First of all, it makes use of the common IP transport plane and the web services realization mechanism as a backbone for composite services within a single session. This would help network operators to generate revenue in a converged Telecom network. Secondly, it uses web services to automate the entire lifecycle of a service. This leads to automation of the Service Delivery Platform (SDP), which in turn allows third party application providers to deploy services by using the services exposed by Network Provider. Finally, as premium composite services are deployed to the end user, he/she would have a higher Quality of Experience (QoE). IMS provides a per-subscriber control of QoS as part of QoE. As the subscriber uses various composite services, the IMS ability to control QoE/QoS, becomes a huge differentiator for IMS over just uncontrolled access over the internet. In other words, IMS QoE encompasses QoS, enhanced GUI and IMS Composite Service, and not be just the experience of using the Composite service.

10265,SOAF: An Architectural Framework for Service Definition and Realization.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach for building distributed systems that deliver application functionality as a set of self-contained business-aligned services with well-defined and discoverable interfaces. This paper presents a systematic and architecture-centric framework, named Service Oriented Architecture Framework (SOAF), to ease the definition, the design and the realization of SOA in order to achieve a better business and IT alignment. The proposed framework is businessprocess centric and comprises a set of structured activities grouped in five phases. It incorporates a range of techniques and guidelines for systematically identifying services, deciding service granularity and modeling services while integrating existing operational/legacy systems. The results from a pilot validation of SOAF for SOA enablement of a realistic Securities Trading application are presented. Best practices and lessons learned are also discussed.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10266,QoS Support for Media Broadcast in a Services Oriented Architecture.,"Service-oriented architectures allow content providers to enable easy and transparent access to multimedia content for their clients as well as outsource non-strategic streaming services to thirdparty providers. We design a QoS framework and associated algorithms that can provide prioritized and fair media streaming based on service level agreements. We formulate the QoS support as a Multiple Choice Multiple Knapsack optimization and design several low-complexity algorithms to provide approximate solutions. We bound the performance of these algorithms, and evaluate them in terms of the number of clients supported and QoS provided over realistic simulation scenarios.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10267,Service Views: a Coherent View Model of the SOA in the Enterprise.,"Architecture views are a popular technique used for documenting and describing software systems architecture through a number of views, each of which cater to a certain group of stakeholders. With the increasing adoption of service oriented architecture and the deployment of Web Service based applications both internally and externally, organizations need an improved framework for representing and documenting the service architecture. To this end, we propose a well defined set of views that describe services within the enterprise, including primitive as well as composite service views. In this manner, the proposed model achieves consistency and coherence among different views, thus providing a unified view model for service oriented systems within an organization.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

This requires to build Internet scale distributed systems in complex, heterogeneous environments characterized by stringent requirements regarding security and evolution. In this paper, we argue that software engineering tools are needed in order to facilitate the work of application developers. This paper presents a Model-Driven Engineering approach for the development of a specific tool, dedicated to the development of industrial services for power distribution industry.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10269,An SOA Compass for Next Generation Networks.,"Next Generation Networks (NGNs) are faced with a perennial problem of adding newer services at a very short time period, and with very high levels of quality, and this has really made them think of innovative solutions to quickly adapt to the situation. It is imperative that the NGN service providers consider and use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and its principles to achieve business goals and optimize longterm capital investment without compromising customer experience. We have studied the current problems faced by NGN Service Providers, and arrived at an innovative solution based on mathematical model to assist the Next Generation Network (NGN) service providers to use quantitative metrics to reach higher levels of service orientation. In addition, this methodology can be used to measure and optimize every investment made towards SOA alignment. Also, this methodology can be used to perform ""what-if"" analysis, in order to assess the impact of the business decisions without actually implementing those decisions.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10270,Service-Oriented Computing Kit.,"This paper describes a Service-Oriented Computing Kit (SOCK), which is an overarching framework covering the key artifacts in planning, modeling, designing, developing, deploying, and managing service-oriented solutions in the enterprise computing space. Based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, this comprehensive kit is a systematic taxonomy to abstract complexities and organize the major aspects of service-oriented development, so that the roles, responsibilities, accountabilities, skillsets, procedures and deliverables can be clearly defined for the IT teams to effectively construct service-oriented systems. SOCK comprises eight modules - Architecture, Process, Integration, Environment, Technology, Development, Management, and Roadmap. Each module addresses specific technical concerns in particular areas. SOA provides the service definitions, service catalog, service composition, scope of applications and portfolios, and service architecture modeling methodology. SOP deals with the business process management, process modeling & notations, process orchestration, coordination/collaborations, human interactions, and 1-phase commit compensation for long-lived processes. SOI concentrates on the service interoperability, integration patterns, enterprise service bus, traditional synchronous/asynchronous enterprise application integration, and integration with portals and content management systems. SOE consists of the runtime infrastructure, service registry for discovery and directory, service transformation/routing gateway, service virtualization via grid computing, and quality-of-services compliance with service-level agreements. SOT covers the implementation technologies - web services, standards and specifications, technical patterns, convergence, and aspect-oriented techniques. SOD is composed of the development lifecycle, programming model, design/development tools, frameworks, reusable utilities/toolkits/components, and model-driven approaches. SOM includes services & policies repository in service identification and categorization, security mechanisms, business activity monitoring, reporting, BI, and provisioning. SOR handles the planning/blueprint, strategy, KPI dashboards, governance, and organization. The elements in each module are further decomposed to form loose semantic associations. This holistic kit has been implemented on an open source mind-mapping platform, which is used in guiding the migration from the conventional multi-tier web application style to a service-oriented paradigm in the financial services sector, and SOCK has proven to be an effective approach to pragmatically transitioning to the new computing mode.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10271,Discovering HealthGrid Services.,"HealthGrids represent the next generation of advanced healthcare IT and hold the promise to resolve complex healthcare problems by integrating health information systems and healthcare entities. Healthcare could benefit from a new delivery approach using HealthGrids to better meet the bio-medical and health-related needs. Specialized services are needed to provide unified discovery of and ubiquitous access to available HealthGrid resources. This paper identifies different types of services available on HealthGrids and classifies them into two-levels, the Operational Level and the Management Level.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10272,SOA and Web Services.,"This tutorial presents the foundational knowledge for the researchers and practitioners on Service- Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web services. The traditional ""triangleÂ” SOA and variations that better support SOA services and solutions will be examined. Critical Web services infrastructures will be covered, such as WSDL, BPEL, WSRF, Discovery, Composition, Registry, and Web services invocation and relationship binding. How Web 2.0 and SOA can benefit with each other will also be explored.

10273,Business Process Adaptations via Protocols.,"Business process management in service-oriented computing (SOC) environments poses special challenges. In particular, SOC environments are dynamic, thereby requiring frequent changes in business processes. Current business process modeling approaches handle such changes in an ad hoc manner, and lack a principled means of determining what needs to be changed and where. This paper addresses process adaptability through a novel application of business protocols, especially of protocol composition, introduced in our previous work. Through a real business scenario of auto-insurance claim processing, this paper demonstrates how a wide range of adaptations can be handled naturally and systematically via protocol composition. The illustrated adaptations have been evaluated via a prototype.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10274,A Flexible Framework for Tools Integration using Service Oriented Architecture.,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is making strides into every industry, and is providing consumer centric approach to the end-to-end solution. In the business world, acquisitions and mergers are very common. Whenever an acquisition or merger happens, it is required to consolidate the business assets. It is possible to use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to arrive at an excellent framework for integrating and consolidating these business assets (which typically include business processes and the various software packages). We have designed and built a software framework for integrating various tools used within Global Delivery India Center.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10275,Beyond SOA: Context-Aware Composite Services.,"Context Aware Services are the next generation of the Service Computing Paradigm. In this Industry report we explore a case study of creating contextaware services for the telecommunications industry. The SOA paradigm is a logical means of building and exposing context aware services in the form of composite applications. Context-Aware Services can be exemplified by the ability of a pre-programed cellphone to detect your current location, collate this with a time of day, city and events such as lunch or dinner along with the preferences of cuisine. It can then inform you as you are walking down a street that your favorite Chinese cuisine can be found using the following directions. A Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is usually context-free. The addition of relevant context-based information about user profiles, rules pertaining to an industry (such as telco) domain allows the integration of domain-specific languages into the SOA paradigm by defining a set of production rules that the context will use to determine the course of action(s) to take as events are coming in (e.g., through the Business Mobility Platform described in this paper).",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10276,Using Data Semantics to Enable Automatic Composition of Web Services.,"This paper demonstrates the automatic creation of a web service that chains together existing web services to achieve a particular goal. The generated service implements the necessary workflows to convert an instance data of one system into an instance data of another. This paper further demonstrates the reconciliation of structural, syntactic, and representational mismatches between the input instance and the desired output instance.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10277,A Dynamic Service-Oriented Implementation for Java EE Servers.,"This paper proposes to enhance the dynamism and the flexibility of Java Enterprise Edition (EE) servers by introducing a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) inside. The purpose is to ease the deployment and offer dynamic server configuration and reconfiguration. Such an approach limits consumed resources and is capable of context adaptation. After defining the properties that must be verified for the service platform, we propose to use OSGi technology as the basis for the architecture. We have experimented with integrating OSGi into Java EE servers. Moreover, this architecture has been chosen for the next generation of JOnAS ObjectWeb's open source Java EE implementation.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10278,Modeling Non-Functional Aspects in Service Oriented Architecture.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style to reuse and integrate subsystems in existing systems for designing new applications. Each application is designed in an implementation independent manner using abstract concepts: network services and connections between network services. In SOA, the non-functional aspects of services and connections should be described separately from their functional aspects because different applications use services and connections in different non-functional contexts. This paper proposes a UML profile to graphically design the non-functional aspects in SOA and maintain them in an implementation independent manner. This paper presents the design of the proposed UML profile and describes how it is used in service-oriented application development.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10279,Drivers for SOA in the Transaction Banking Domain.,"In a competitive business landscape, banks are under pressure to innovate, improvise and differentiate their products and services while continuing to reduce the time-to-market for new product introductions. The rise of new businesses and newer ways of doing existing businesses has significantly influenced the need for a better assessment of the business value realized from the IT investments. Client Relationship managers, Product managers etc are facing the need to be innovative and flexible in their offerings to the client and they demand an agile delivery infrastructure (process & IT) to support them in this regard. In banks operating multiple lines of businesses, generating a Single view of the customer is a critical both from a marketing perspective as well as Risk Management perspective.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10280,Agent based Resource Brokering and Allocation in Wireless Grids.,"This paper presents an agent based model for discovery, brokering and allocation of cost effective resources to computational jobs. A wireless grid environment of virtual organizations is considered. Agents are employed to perform resource brokering and allocation tasks. The model is simulated for different wireless grid scenarios, to test its operational effectiveness.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10281,Towards Self-Composing Prioritized and Consequential Services.,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is emerging as a very significant approach to enterprise computing. SOA is seen as a major impetus to providing agility and consumer centric approach to enterprise computing. Integral to the Service Oriented Architecture approach is the concept of a ""service"", a service provider and a service consumer. The services in SOA context are realized by software or software in conjunction with business processes. It is believed that significant value can be derived by designing intelligent services. Benefit will include overall performance and flexibility. Intelligent services are those that are able to compose themselves based on certain rules and configurations, able to come into existence only when required and only for a required duration, and are prioritized. It is found out that these attributes make the services extremely useful, and enhance the overall performance of the SOA deployment.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10282,Event-driven Dynamic Web Services Composition and Automation of Business Processes.,"B2B and long running B2C process are a complex business process that contains set of services, state, transaction management, and involve notification of events occur during the execution of process. Business processes are driven by events and evaluating the business processes at regional or national scale reveals diversity in products, terminology and processes involved in carrying out a complete business activity. Because of dynamic nature, heterogeneity and lack of knowledge among business partner there is a need of mechanism to compose services dynamically according to events, and to provide interoperable integration for automation of business process. We proposed convergence of semantic web, web services and grid computing to achieve context and location based interoperable integration, event-driven dynamic composition, scalable architecture and middleware support for state, transaction, notification and lifecycle management of business process.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10283,A Knowledge Model-driven Recommender System for Business Transformation.,"Engineering approach for transforming business process and workforce management is an emerging area that is gaining increasing interest for its many promising applications in service science. Yet, three major challenges stand out in engineering any business transformation process. The first challenge is accurate modeling of the transformation knowledge that may be scattered across multiple application domains. The second challenge is efficient and precise real-time evaluation based on the knowledge model. The third challenge will be to generate intelligent recommendations about business transformation that can significantly improve the business process and drive down opportunity costs. This paper proposes an integrated knowledge modeldriven recommender system that effectively addresses all of the three abovementioned challenges of modeling, evaluating, and recommending. Using a real-world case study on warranty processing at a major automotive manufacturer, this paper presents a novel business transformation framework that consists of a knowledge model on business value drivers and metrics, an evaluation engine for processing real-time business events, and a recommendation engine that utilizes information obtained from the evaluation engine to suggest new processes and workforce allocation strategy, which can be subjected to a new cycle of modeling and evaluation to complete a feedback loop. Our experimental study using the real-world data results in a ""25/75"" rule in predictive warranty data processing: 25% of information contains 75% of business information entropy, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the system.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10284,A Model-Driven Approach to Service Composition in Virtual Enterprises.,"This paper proposes a model driven approach whereby a composite service specification is generated automatically from a simple declarative definition. I t is based o n three concepts: services, virtual enterprises and business rules. Using a n e-travel application as a running example we explain in detail the steps of the generation process. Particularly, we show how business rules can be used for creating o n the jly the controlflow relating the services constituting the composite service.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10285,A Language-based Approach to Service Deployment.,"This paper presents a language-based approach to service deployment. The language is called Abacus, which is a service-oriented programming language for grid applications. In Abacus, a service is abstracted as a basic language construct, and service deployment is expressed by a deployment statement. This approach allows an Abacus application to automatically deploy a service at runtime without any configuration information. This paper compares the development detail in the Abacus environment with that in the manual deployment environment, and evaluates our deployment approach accordingly. On the one hand, this approach frees maintainers from annoying deployment work at low-level, which helps to enhance the productivity in building grid applications. On the other hand, this approach allows services to be deployed according to the application logic, helping to improve the utilization and the management of various grid resources.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10286,Solution Architecture for N-Tier Applications.,"This paper defines a service-oriented Solution Architecture for N-Tier Applications (SANTA), primarily for web-based distributed systems. Most conventional Internet applications have been built on three tiers - web, application, and database tiers as described in the predominant 3-tier architectural style on both Java EE and .Net platforms. However, a number of leading-edge technologies have matured, which need to be incorporated into the logical solution architecture, such as portal, process choreography, business rule engine, enterprise service bus, web services, service composition, etc. A new serviceoriented model is proposed in this paper, to extend the traditional 3-tier architectural style and position the emerging technologies/products in the right places in the architecture structure. This new architecture model comprises a stack of six interrelated layers, coupled with six vertical pillars. The six layers are Access & Integration, Business Process, Composite Services, Services & Components, Integration & Communications, and Enterprise Resources layer. The Runtime Infrastructure pillars are composed of the Operational Management, Security, and Hosting Environment pillar, whereas the Development Process pillars consist of the Application & Service Frameworks, Crosscutting Aspects & Patterns, and Modeling & Development Tools pillar. This holistic application architecture framework is a systematic taxonomy of major technical constituents of a distributed application in a service-oriented paradigm. Part of this comprehensive model has been extensively utilized in one form or another to design various SOA solutions in different industry sectors.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10287,Co-Innovation in a Service Oriented Strategic Network.,"This paper is based on the view that the adoption of service oriented architectures (SOA) by large information system (IS) vendors might push software development towards an industrialized mode of operation. The emergence of such a software ecosystem is analyzed through an innovation perspective. The special nature of software as an intellectual technology, thus being an intangible product as opposed to physical products, is given special emphasis. Since digital products are expensive to produce, but cheap to reproduce, it is argued on the basis of a resource-based view that this ecosystem should not solely be built on the trading of software, but also on the exchange of business knowledge.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10288,A SOA based Self-Adaptive PERSONAL MOBILITY MANAGER.,"Service oriented applications integrate heterogenous web services, which are deployed and maintained by different providers, and can evolve dynamically and autonomously. Autonomous changes of web services manifest only at run time, and may lead to unexpected failures. This paper proposes an approach to designing selfadaptive applications, which can react to changes in the implementation of services, thus avoiding unexpected failures. The architecture proposed in this paper automatically detects possible integration mismatches, and dynamically executes suitable adaptation strategies. The paper presents an application, the Personal Mobility Manager, which integrates heterogeneous web services, identifies failures that derive from dynamic changes in the integrated services, and illustrates the self-adaptive design solution which can prevent run time failures.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10289,Consideration of Operation Composition in Semantic Service Matchmaking.,"With the number of services presented on the open Internet growing at an explosive speed, it subsequently brings great challenges to the accurate, efficient and automatic retrieval of target services for consumers. At present, many service matchmaking algorithms are proposed. However, most of them deem that a service is equal to a single functional unit or several separate units. In fact, a service may contain several functional units which are not separated from each other. Some implied relations may exist among the functional units so that they can be composed to provide new functions. This paper proposes a new service matchmaking algorithm that takes the composition of functional units within a service into consideration. This algorithm has been applied in a service composition framework called DartFlow. Our experimental data show that this novel service matchmaking outperforms others in terms of the recall rate and precision.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10290,Evaluation of Strategies for Integrating Legacy Applications as Services in a Service Oriented Architecture.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an approach for building distributed systems that deliver application functionality as a set of self-contained business-aligned services. It promises lower integration costs, increased reusability and improved enterprise agility and adaptability. One of the key obstacles for SOA is the presence of existing legacy applications that support critical business processes but are inflexible and hard to adapt for integration with other business applications. This paper presents a survey of key approaches to integrate/transform legacy applications into services to participate in an enterprise-wide SOA. It also presents a decision framework to guide architects in selecting the optimal combination of legacy modernization options.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10291,Individual Tariffs for Mobile Services: Bargaining Model and Calculation.,"This paper aims to develop a bargaining model for calculation of individual tariffs for mobile service bundles. The paper first looks shortly at the intrinsic drivers of individual tariffs both from sociological and economic perspectives. It proceeds with a bargaining model for individual tariffs which is centered on user and supplier behaviours. The user, instead of being fully rational, has ""bounded rationality"" and his behaviours are not only subject to economic constraints but also influenced by social needs. Individual tariffs are decided through interactions between the user and the supplier. Game theory is employed to provide structured analyses of the interactions and tariff design. Preliminary results, which are based on a music training service, show that individual tariffs can be beneficial to both the user and the supplier.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10292,Security in SOA and Web Services.,"Security is today a relevant requirement for any distributed application, and in particular for these enabled by the Web such as e-health, e-commerce, and e-learning. It is thus crucial that the use of Web services, stand-alone or composed, provide strong security guarantees. Web services security encompasses several requirements that can be described along the well known security dimensions, that is: integrity, whereby a message must remain unaltered during transmission; confidentiality, whereby the contents of a message cannot be viewed while in transit, except by authorized services; availability, whereby a message is promptly delivered to the intended recipient, thus ensuring that legitimate users receive the services they are entitled to. Moreover, each Web service must protect its own resources against unauthorized access. This in turn requires suitable means for: identification, whereby the recipient of a message must be able to identify the sender; authentication, whereby the recipient of a message needs to verify the claimed identity of the sender; authorization, whereby the recipient of a message needs to apply access control policies to determine whether the sender has the right to use the required resources.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10293,Semantic based Service-Oriented Grid Architecture for Business Processes.,"B2B and long running B2C process is a complex business process that contains a set of services, state and transaction management, and involves notification of various events occurring during the execution of a process. Business processes are driven by events and each process should be capable to handle the dynamic nature of enterprise and business partners like change in the strategies, policies and exception handling. Execution of a business process at regional or national scale involves diversity in products, terminology and processes involved to carry out a complete business activity. Complete execution of a process requires dynamic composition of distributed services based on events. Heterogeneity, dynamic nature and lack of knowledge among business partners demand a scalable architecture, which can provide seamless interoperable integration of distributed heterogeneous services and automation of business processes with the management of state and transaction, notification of various events, and execution and monitoring of a process. In this paper, we have proposed Semantic based Service-Oriented Grid Architecture to demonstrate how semantics can be employed in SOA to deliver common vocabulary, knowledge, and automation of a business process and how grid middleware can be used to provide state, transaction, notification, scalability, and execution and monitoring of business processes.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10294,A Framework & Negotiation Protocol for Service Contracts.,"This paper presents a specification for a domainindependent, symmetrical, two-party negotiation protocol to reach binding agreements between services based on the principles of contract law. The protocol is necessary as existing specifications, such as WS-Agreement, lack the capability to form negotiated agreements and lack sufficient rigor in their design. This leads to ambiguities in their interpretations and, therefore, possible interoperability problems between different implementations. The negotiation protocol fits into the modular, high-level framework also presented here, that can be completed using a variety of existing contract monitoring and management procedures.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10295,Automatic Web Service Composition.,"The tutorial aims at providing a deep comprehension of the Web Service Composition problem and automated techniques to tackle it. Web Service Composition is currently one of the most hyped and addressed issue in the Service Oriented Computing. Starting from an analysis of current technologies and standards for Web Service Composition, the tutorial will lead the attendees to consider formal models at the base of current proposals, and techniques that can be fruitfully considered to address automatic composition synthesis in each of them. More in detail, attendees will consider: (i) basic technologies and standards for Web Service invocation and description (SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, ...); (ii) advanced technologies and standards for orchestration and inter-organizational process enactment, in particular WSBPEL and WS-CDL; (iii) models for Web Service composition; (iv) formal tools for both data-centric and process-centric synthesis, including query reformulation a'la Data Integration, transition-systems based formalisms, trace-based formalisms, logics of programs and processes. In particular, we will show how these formal tools can be applied for Automatic Web Service Composition; (v) current state-of-the-art research results in automatic service composition, drawing a comparison and defining a unifying framework.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10297,Implementing Shared Data Services (SDS): A Proposed Approach.,"Database related spending is always a significant cost sink for most CIOs. One component of this spending may be related to maintenance, upgrades, physical hardware costs and other routine items that may not be avoidable. However, a large chunk of the spending may be due to inefficiencies in the data storage mechanism, redundancies in the storage of critical data elements, replication of data access logic and proliferation in the specific data storage technology used. Some of these issues may be addressed by a comprehensive data architecture strategy that attempts to tackle these inconsistencies and redundancies. In this paper, we present architecture for shared data services that may be implemented at an enterprise level to tackle issues associated with data scatter, redundancy and replication. We discuss in detail the various components of such architecture and their applicability towards specific problem areas.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10298,Concepts for Service-Oriented Business Thinking.,"As businesses scramble to adopt and implement Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) it is imperative that service-oriented thinking become an integral part of the business itself. We motivate the key concepts for service-oriented business thinking through a range of examples that give a flavor of a range of businesses. In this paper we establish three key concepts - Service Agreement, Service Transaction and Service Function. These concepts are discussed in depth and are related to our ongoing work in the area of modeling business services.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10300,Ontology Reconciliation for Service-Oriented Computing.,"Service-oriented computing (SOC) is viewed as the computing paradigm of the near future, allowing for the dynamic interaction of services provided by distributed business partners. Being a declarative knowledge representation model, ontologies serve as a foundation for SOC. Due to the heterogeneous nature of independently designed ontologies, it is problematic for partners to understand the concepts adopted in ontologies from other sources. In order for partners to achieve seamless collaboration of services, they need to reconcile their ontologies with each other. During the alignment process and the following service interactions, compatibility is an important measurement that has been neglected in most research work. We extend a vector system to encode ontology compatibility. In addition, we present a new model - probabilistic center ontology - for better recording and maintenance of ontology alignment results. Our precise and efficient approach is verified by both theoretic proofs and experimental results.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10301,An OO based Semantic Model for Service Oriented Computing.,"The need for having interoperable systems despite the presence of heterogeneous platforms has resulted in tremendous growth and acceptance of Web Services in recent years. This success of Web Services technology is fueling research efforts towards generalization into a science for Service Oriented Computing (SOC). However, beyond the basic publish-find-bind model there is not much consensus yet on what are the architectural building blocks of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). In this paper, we present a semantic model for SOC that is based upon established and well proven techniques of object oriented paradigm.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In this paper we present and compare approaches for modelling CBPs based on the serviceoriented architecture paradigm. By embedding our overall approach into a model- and architecturedriven development perspective, we show how serviceoriented systems realising CBPs can be derived from business-level modelling.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10303,The Service Integration Maturity Model: Achieving Flexibility in the Transformation to SOA.,"Historically, the link between business executives and their company's IT organization has been weak, obscure and difficult. Barriers to effective communication between business leaders and IT leaders included bad funding models, a poor understanding of each others needs, issues and timelines and a long history of failed initiatives - on both sides. Also, as IT importance grew exponentially, the business understanding of that importance did not always keep up. Twenty-first century companies know that their IT systems are their life-blood, but getting to that understanding has been long in coming. With the rise of the Internet and the examples of Amazon, eBay and other IT miracles, the understanding of the effectiveness of value nets as well as of improved internal processes is pervasive. Executives now agree that they have to change or fail. enough, though. Many companies still rely completely but implicitly on a patchwork of unmanageable decades-old systems whose buildersand their knowledge - are long gone.

10304,Interoperability among Heterogeneous Services.,"Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) has been marked as the technology trend which caters for the interoperability among the components of a distributed system. However, the emergence of various incompatible instantiations of the SOC paradigm e.g. web, grid and p2p services, as well as the interoperability problems encountered within each of these instantiations (e.g. web service interoperability problems addressed by the WS-I Basic Profile) state clearly that interoperability is still elusive. In order to address this problem we first need to identify all problem dimensions and consequently to provide appropriate solutions. Within this paper we describe a set of interoperability dimensions that need to be considered and we present a generic service model which we view as a first step in addressing some of the identified problem dimensions.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10317,Business Agility and Process Management.,"The turbulent modern business environments require firms to be more flexible and agile. This requires ability to quickly integrate and automate intra and inter-organizational business processes. An agile IT architecture is key to achieving success in this environment. Service oriented architecture and Web services provide means for achieving the business agility; however, significant impediments to wide scale adoption and use of these technologies remain. We will focus on significant challenges in the areas of service identification and design, cataloging and searching for appropriate services, domain specific standardization of service interfaces, matching service functionality with requirements, and service selection based on non functional characteristics. We describe an integrated framework based on standard modeling, design and code generation tools to support development of highly agile application systems. This framework is a result of multi year research effort aimed at developing methodologies and tools for defining business components and Web Services, develop schemes for describing components and services in business terms to allow efficient search of appropriate component/services and an environment for assembling application from reusable components and web services. Specific approaches used to address some of the challenges described above will be discussed.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10320,Web Services on Rails: Using Ruby and Rails for Web Services Development and Mashups.,"One of the interesting aspects of the Web 2.0 'evolution' is the wide-availability of various Web applications as APIs or Web services. These APIs expose informational services on the Web and take many forms of remote invocation of functions using standard Web protocols and XML for data representations, e.g., REST, SOAP/WSDL, XML-RPC, and other approaches. The services (or APIs) are also usually accompanied by user facing Web applications for human-consumption. Canonical examples are Google Maps, Yahoo! Flykr and del.icio.us, EVDB's Eventful's application and API, Amazon.com's S3, ECS, Alexa, and many others. The Ruby programming language and its Rails framework are ideal for programming Web applications and services in the Web 2.0. Ruby's modern and dynamic features make it an excellent language for rapid prototyping and integration of various Web services. Rails' superb support for rapid Web application development, database access, and AJAX, make it well suited for creating front-ends and back-ends to the next generation of Web applications and services. In this tutorial we will take a hands-on deep-dive into the Ruby and Rails platform and learn how they can be used to: (1) create Web applications backed by a relational database, (2) consume Web services, (3) create and deploy APIs or Web services, and (4) mashup of existing Web services and applications. No a priori knowledge of Ruby or Rails is required - although some programming in a modern OO language and Web application development are definite plus.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10321,Architecture for Service Request Driven Solution Delivery Using Grid Systems.,"Today grid infrastructures are increasingly required to handle complex service requests requiring configuration and deployment of customized solutions. Existing tools and technologies are labor intensive and result in inefficient and wasteful use of both human and IT resources. In this paper, we describe Harmony II - an architecture for delivering customized solutions using an approach that is policy driven and is amenable to a high degree of automation.Our approach is modular, which facilitates customization using building blocks of IT resources. Lower level raw IT resources are virtualized allowing flexible and policy-based resource sharing. Flexible resource sharing reduces wasteful use of expensive IT resources and allows business goals to dictate how the resources are to be used. Cost savings in IT management are achieved not only by the automation in service delivery, but also by the novel use of building blocks and solution templates.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10322,Applying Distributed Business Rules - The VIDRE Approach.,"Today's business processes are not static, they need to be adapted frequently to reflect changing business requirements. Several business process languages such as WS-BPEL have emerged for specifying business processes based on Web service technologies. Activities in such business processes are typically implemented asWeb services by using modern programming languages. These services encapsulate the business logic in terms of application-specific code. This approach lacks flexibility in terms of capturing and executing the business rules that define how certain activities work and how decisions are made. Changing"" ""hard-coded"" business rules leads to changes in the service implementations and it cannot be done efficiently without redeploying the service which may affect running business processes. Therefore, we propose VIDRE a distributed service-oriented business rule engine, which enables business processes or enterprise applications to access business rules as easily as a database by exposing them as Web services. Furthermore, VIDRE enables the definition of distributed business rules, a novel feature allowing a distributed execution of rules.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10323,Using State Machine to Integrate Human Activity into BPEL in Dartflow.,"The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) has emerged as the de-facto standard for cross-organizational business processes and business interaction protocols for connecting web services. At the beginning of BPEL, people mainly focused on automated business process execution. Although intended as a language for connecting web services, BPEL has been applied by ambitious people to realize a wide variety of process-aware intra-organizational application, which gives the heavier burden on BPEL than ever. Faced with emerging wider scenarios (complex human activity, various non-web service APIs, etc), original BPEL has difficulties for fulfilling the new requirement. Human activities have complex and dynamic impact on business process execution. BPEL was designed for automated service-to-service interactions, and did not define mechanisms interacting with people in its current version. Considering most modern business processes commonly involving some extent of human-intensive workflow, inability of specification is actually serious, and in some cases fatal. To complement the lack of BPEL on human-driven workflow, and coordinate work performed by human-driven workflows and automated processes, this paper presents a novel four-step procedure. In the first step, we distinguish human activity from automated process among business process, and treat them as external process and internal process, respectively. While the former supports a more event-driven, flexible and dynamic human-driven workflow with unstructured data, the latter, as lower part of the former, supports sequential, predefined and static approach with structured data. In the second step, we utilize State Machine to model the human-driven workflow. The State Machine provides a flexible and efficient way to model the more loosely defined nature of human workflow. In the third step, we transform the State Machine-style workflow to the BPEL-style process. In the fourth step, we integrate external BPEL-style human-driven process with internal sequential automated process into a complete BPEL process. The latter is invoked by the former as a single web service via standard 'invoke' activity in BPEL, or as a sub-process via extensive 'call' activity in BPEL-SPE.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
10324,Designing Enterprise Solutions with Web Services and Integration Patterns.,"Web services are an ideal implementation platform for integrating disparate legacy systems because they are platform-independent. Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) represent possible design solutions that may be used to construct these enterprise integration solutions. Constructing design solutions with EIP that build on the platform-independence allowed by web services requires that the former be converted into mechanisms that may be implemented with the latter. One such mechanism is conversation models that may be used to implement interactions among web services representing different legacy systems. No methodologies exist that designers can use to construct integration solutions using web services and EIP in this manner. In this paper, we outline such a methodology that generates the design elements in the form of conversation policies for web services.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

10330,Multiagent Policy Architecture for Virtual Business Organizations.,"A virtual organization (VO) is a dynamic collection of entities (individuals, enterprises, and information resources) collaborating on some computational activity. VOs are an emerging means to model, enact, and manage largescale service computations. VOs consist of autonomous, heterogeneous members, often exhibiting complex behaviors. Thus VOs are a natural match for policy-based approaches. Traditional policybased frameworks emphasize reactive behaviors, wherein an external request causes a policy engine to compute a response. However, business service settings require richer policies and call for proactive behaviors. A business not only must respond to explicit requests, but also monitor its environment, collate events, and potentially act in anticipation of events in order to ensure that its policies are satisfied. Autonomous, heterogeneous, proactive entities are best modeled as agents and, therefore, VOs are best understood as multiagent systems. Our main contributions are (1) a proactive multiagent policy-based architecture, (2) a hierarchical model of policy monitoring, compliance checking, and enforcement for VOs, and (3) a formalization of VOs. We evaluate our approach using a real business service scenario.",2006,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

An important need of many adaptive processes is for concurrent activities in the process to respect coordination constraints. These require that concurrent activities coordinate their behaviors in response to exogenous events. We show how coordination inducing constraints may be represented in WS-BPEL, and use generalized adaptation and constraint enforcement models to transform the traditional BPEL process to an adaptive one. The final outcome is an executable WS-BPEL process without extensions, able to adapt to events while respecting coordination constraints between activities.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,

The conventional HNS has been built on the single-vendor system, which severely limits potential of the HNS. To overcome the problem, this paper presents a method that constructs the HNS with multi-vendor appliances. The proposed method first defines vendor-neutral standard services, with which various HNS applications and services are developed. Then, we exploit a dynamic service binding mechanism, which bindseach standard service on a vendor-specific API of an appliance during run-time. With this mechanism, common HNS applications and services can be achieved by various combinations of multi-vendor appliances. Moreover, replacing any appliance with another never affects the execution of the applications. We have implemented the proposed method using Apache Axis Web services and Rhino JavaScript engine. The experimental evaluation showed that our implementation works well for a practical HNS with sufficiently small overhead.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

A few efforts have been made to facilitate hosting of web services on such devices, but the proposed solutions do not always conform to the multiple web service standards and security frameworks that have been proposed by the web service community. Secondly, the performance of these solutions is often limited due to the resource limitations of mobile devices. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by introducing a novel system partitioning technique to be used by a web service provider so that a few WS components can be executed on an intermediate node. The use of the proposed partitioning technique for a WS execution environment has shown a significant performance improvement. The proposed partitioning technique is analyzed using a prototype WS execution environment hosting sample web services.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Strategies to differentiate service offerings have to be unintrusive â€“ without requiring major changes to the existing service realization mechanisms. In this paper, we present a strategy for service providers to differentiate their commoditized services. We show how to identify and document differentiating aspects of a service. By unintrusively manipulating these differentiation aspects we can differentiate services from that of competition. We specify these differentiating aspects as service policies using the WS-Policy framework.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Tourists are expected to be important and demanding users of location-based services. They will need customized means to filter their experience of destinations, as well as ways to meaningfully participate in the creation of narratives and histories about different places. Mobile technologies will also allow tourists to be more discriminating in their patronage of different service offerings, especially as they gain greater knowledge of so-called ""backstage"" processes. These demanding needs will require choreography between services offered by many different commercial, cultural, educational, and community providers. The paper suggests approaches to deliver tourist location-based services based on low barrier of entry principles of web architecture. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the erosion of backstage/front-stage distinctions in service systems impacts service innovation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

In this paper, we propose an architecture called GSMA (Grid SLA Management Architecture) that supports entire operations in SLA lifecycle such as negotiation, creation, monitoring, violation, enforcement and destroy. We propose a deviation based resource ordering algorithm (DRS) and successfully automates the SLA negotiation process with backing up of resource support. The negotiation process is implemented based on WS Agreement specification. Simulation results against gridway meta scheduler shows improved performance interms of average SLA creation time, success rate and throughput.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

It is an essential part of the competitive business cycle. Existing consulting methods and tools do not address issues such as scalability of methodology, knowledge management, asset reuse, and governance well, to name a few. This paper presents Business Transformation Workbench, a practitioner's tool for business transformation addressing these problems. It implements a methodical approach that was devised to analyze business transformation opportunities and make business cases for transformation initiatives and thereby provides decision-support to the consultants. It provides an intuitive way to evaluate and understand various opportunities in staff and IT consolidation and process standardization. It embodies structured analytical models, both qualitative and quantitative, to enhance the consultants' practices. BT Workbench has been instantiated with data from finance management domain and applied to address a client situation as a case study. An alpha testing of the tool was conducted with about dozen practitioners. 90% of the consultants who tested the BT Workbench tool felt that the tool would help them do a better job during a client engagement.

10475,Study of Execution Centric Payment Issues in E-contracts.,"A contract is a legal agreement involving parties, activities, clauses and payments. The activities are to be executed by the parties satisfying the clauses, in accordance with the associated terms of payment. An e-contract is a contract modeled, specified, executed, controlled and monitored by a software system. In this paper, we study payment issues in e-contracts. Payments are meant for, and so are closely related to, the execution of activities specified in the contract. We consider (i) the payment amount for the execution of an activity, (ii) the time of payment relative to the execution and (iii) tracking the payment against the execution of the activity. For the first two, we use an execution model that enables representing a variety of states encountered in the generally complex executions of the activities in a contract. For tracking, we use a multi-level composition model for the activities. Our study brings out various issues that need to be addressed in designing a payment monitoring system.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Existing methods like stud and mock fail to provide the advanced component simulation capabilities required by CIT from perspectives like diversified program artifacts, behavior transitivity, and configurability. This paper proposes a new simulation apparatus, namely surrogate, to address this problem. The surrogate generator generates platform specific code skeleton from definition of the component to be simulated. The generated code communicates with surrogate engine and returns simulated platform specific behaviors. The surrogate engine simulates component behaviors including both output and possible invocation on dependent components. Moreover, it provides platform independent interfaces and configuration model. Early implementations of surrogate generator and surrogate engine are introduced in detail. To validate the value of surrogate technology in CIT, a case study has been carried out with careful analysis. The result shows that this technology really helps identify some bugs at early stage of development.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10477,Exploring the Impact of Queue Management on Quality of Service for SMBs.,"Small to medium businesses (SMBs) are an integral part of the U.S. economy, accounting for about half of private-sector output and employing more than half of private-sector workers. Managing limited resources as well as providing additional services that meet the range of customer expectations and improve the overall customer experience is a non-trivial activity for SMBs, who like any business, must focus on the seemingly conflicting goals of minimizing cost while maximizing customer value and profit. Queue management has been a problem for many years as an organization's ability (or inability) to adequately address queue management often has a direct correlation to the quality a customer associates with an overall service experience. This study describes Queue Admin, a database driven, online application designed to support SMBs in the management of various queues uncovering the impact that Queue Admin's design and delivery has on the quality of customers' overall service experience.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10478,On Improving Change Management Process for Enterprise IT Services.,"In this paper, we consider the Change Management Process for Enterprise IT services with the goal of improving the efficiency of this process, i.e., minimizing change completion time and maximizing the ""change capacity"". The change management process handles critical updates in the system that must be implemented by a set of executing personnel. In presence of such timing constraints and scheduling conflicts between change classes, we argue that addressing the application change management question optimally involves computing solutions to NP-hard problems. Using appropriate simulation models, we evaluate various batched scheduling alternatives to understand the effect of simple process re-engineering on the change completion time, and the change capacity of the system. In addition, we examine the benefit of executor cross-training and degree of conflicts on the performance of the system. Our results indicate that a simple longest queue based scheduling approach works well in a wide range of practical scenarios. Based on these results, we recommend process re-engineering based on longest queue based scheduling with a small degree of executor cross-training.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10479,Declarative Web Service Entities with Virtual Endpoints.,"The shape of entities used in web services are mainly defined with the idea of a specific business case in mind. As soon as any third party uses these web services with another perception of the process, the shape of the entities may not be optimal any longer. Our paper proposes a solution that involves the service consumer party by letting the service consumer re-define the entities. Two architectural approaches are shown that provide an unobtrusive solution towards dynamic shaped web service entities. Furthermore we discuss the principles of declarative web services and the usage of context oriented programming for our concept of virtual endpoints.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10480,A Fault Propagation Approach for Highly Distributed Service Compositions.,"Today, the techniques for realizing service compositions (e.g. WS-BPEL) have become mature. Nevertheless, when it comes to execution faults within service compositions, many problems are still unsolved. Especially the propagation and global handling of errors in service compositions yet remains an open issue. In this paper, we describe some preliminary results of our ongoing work in the field of fault propagation and exception handling in service compositions. We provide some service classification criteria and show how they relate to service composition fault handling. Further, we present a fault propagation approach for service compositions.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10481,Simplifying Service Deployment with Virtual Appliances.,"As IT services become more powerful and complex, service deployment gets more difficult and expensive. Service deployment, the process of making a service ready for use, often includes deploying multiple, interrelated software components into heterogeneous environments. Different technologies and tools try to address these complexities by describing the environments, abstracting the dependencies, and automating the process. Virtual Appliances, a set of virtual machines including optimized operating systems, pre-built, pre-configured, ready-to-run applications and embedded appliance specific components, are emerging as a breakthrough technology to solve the complexities of service deployment. Virtual appliances provide a simple, unified and easy to use interface for service deployment by encapsulating entire custom environments, and resolving the execution policy constraints and inter-dependencies through pre-installing the software applications. The motivation of this paper is to prove virtual appliances offer a better service deployment mechanism. We start with an easy to understand model to describe the complexity of service deployment and introduce the architecture of a virtual appliance. We then analyze the deployment process of using traditional deployment mechanisms, and quantitatively and qualitatively compare the deployment time, operations and parameters of the traditional approach with the use of virtual appliances. The results show virtual appliances offer significant advantages for service deployment by making the deployment process much simpler and easier, even for the deployment of advanced enterprise services.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10482,SLA Negotiation System Design Based on Business Rules.,"Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are commonly prepared and signed documents that form the contracts between a service provider and its customers, defining the obligations and liabilities of the parties. SLAs reflect the business needs of both customer and supplier as far as possible. SLAs are usually formed through either the adoption of a boiler plate agreement from the provider, or by negotiation between the parties. With the increasing adoption of software supply being implemented as a network service â€“Software as a Service (SaaS) â€“ these methods are rigid or slow and costly. We propose a system that the parties can use to facilitate both fast and flexible agreements through the automation of SLA creation from a combination of Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Business Rules. We look at a means for generating these with a SLA-NM (SLA Negotiation Manager), complying with e-negotiation rules and creates agreements from existing business objectives.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10483,Composable Data Processing in Environmental Science - A Process View.,"Data processing in environmental science is essential for doing science. The heterogeneity of data sources, data processing operations and infrastructures results in a lot of manual data and process integration work done by each scientist individually. This is very inefficient and time consuming. The aim is to provide a view based approach on accessing and processing data supporting a more generic infrastructure to integrate processing steps from different organizations, systems and libraries. We propose an approach modeled in Colored Place/Transition Nets which has been implemented in a Web Service infrastructure.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10484,wsrbench: An On-Line Tool for Robustness Benchmarking.,"Testing web services for robustness is a difficult task. In fact, existing development support tools do not provide any practical mean to assess web services robustness in the presence of erroneous inputs. Previous works proposed that web services robustness testing should be based on a set of robustness tests (i.e., invalid web services call parameters) that are applied in order to discover both programming and design errors. Web services can be classified based on the failure modes observed. In this paper we present and discuss the architecture and use of an on-line tool that provides an easy interface for web services robustness testing. This tool is publicly available and can be used by both web services providers (to assess the robustness of their web services code) and consumers (to select the services that best fit their requirements). The tool is demonstrated by testing several web services available in the Internet.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10485,A Methodology for Model-Driven Web Application Composition.,"Web application composition can greatly benefit from the utilization of existing frameworks and reusable components, in order to reduce development effort. Frameworks implementing the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern standardize the development process to a great extent, while business layer components may consist of consumers of existing web services. On this line of thought a web application can be seen as a composition of web services around a user interface flow. In this paper, an approach for the application of model-driven techniques for the automation of the development of such a web application is presented. Specifically, we present a methodology for the modeling of the application using UML state transition and class diagrams and the generation of the appropriate source code and configuration files. The appropriate UML profiles to assist the service design are defined and the final transformation is performed exploiting model parsing tools.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10486,Modelling Service Systems for Collaborative Innovation in the Enterprise Software Industry - The St. Gallen Media Reference Model Applied.,"As organizational structures shift from centralized and hierarchical structures to decentralized and loosely coupled networks, value creation and innovation processes are changing as well. Especially in the services sector, we observe a shift from closed and company-internal innovation processes to more open and collaborative forms of innovation (e.g. via various types of communities that emerge in enterprises' surrounding ecosystems). Communities of co-innovation or innovation networks can be described from a service systems perspective. In this work, a modelling approach to generally describe service systems is developed leveraging the St. Gallen Media Reference Model (MRM). A specific instantiation of this model is presented that allows for modelling service systems in terms of communities of co-innovation. The model is applied for the case of co-innovation in the enterprise software ecosystem of the SAP AG. The approach fosters understanding, organizing and managing such new networks of collaborative innovation in service science.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10487,SpiG4WSC: A Calculus for Secure Services Composition.,"Orchestration and choreography language provide basic composition techniques and specification among services, but they don't give any secure manners or secure operation styles and specifications. For giving a general guide to implement secure orchestration and choreography, we give a formal approach for carrying out this goal. To this target, we address those by designing an extension of the Spi calculus with Secure Global Calculus. We named our method SpiG4WSC calculus. The combination of strong practical needs for secure Web services composition and the theoretical foundations will lead to a bridge between practice and theories.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Because Web Service Distributed Management specification (WSDM), as an initiative of OASIS organization, helps to build the SOA-Support manageability interfaces of IT resources, we proposed SOAMS-a novel SOA-based system and network Management Scheme and WSDM-based management middle mode for SOAMS. As part of experiment work, we discuss MUSE-JMX based management scheme implementation- SOAMS-Platform, including Manager Layer, WSDM-Gateway Layer, and Agent Layer, and then analyze the prospective research direction.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10489,Mining Process Variants: Goals and Issues.,"Recently, Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) were introduced, which allow for dynamic process and service changes. This, in turn, has led to a large number of process model variants, which are difficult to maintain and expensive to configure. This paper deals with goals and issues related to the mining of process model variants. Our overall goal is to learn from process changes and to ""merge"" the resulting model variants into a generic process model in the best possible way. By adopting this generic process model in the PAIS, future cost of process change and need for process adaptations will decrease.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10490,Grounding and Execution of OWL-S Based Semantic Web Services.,"OWL-S is an ontology for specifying semantic web services written using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). In order to leverage the vast array of existing WSDL-based, non-semantic web services, OWL-S provides a grounding (or binding) mechanism that maps OWL ontological input and output concepts to the standard XML data types used in WSDL input and output messages. In this paper, we discuss an approach using the SPecification and EXecution tool (SPEX), that facilitates the automated generation of OWL-S groundings and associated XSLT transformations and also supports the execution of fully-grounded OWL-S-based semantic web services. In addition, we will present a comprehensive example that will demonstrate the use of the SPEX tool for the grounding and execution activities. This work is a follow-on to our previous work in the area of model-driven semantic web services and is the final piece in the end-to-end development approach.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10491,Solving the Service Composition Puzzle.,"We observed and grouped common service composition techniques into six patterns with distinct characteristics of their integration intermediary. No pattern is better than others in all business and IT situations. Therefore our analysis suggests a formal methodology in impact and cost analysis to justify the choice of composition patterns in service design. Our contribution leads to an advisory tool consisting of questionnaire, semantic reasoning and assessment map to assist IT architects in making a decision of lasting impact. Through solving the service composition puzzle, we hope further values of service oriented architecture may be demonstrated at a fraction of total ownership cost.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10496,Using an Interface Proxy to Host Versioned Web Services.,"Web services have become important building blocks of distributed applications and have matured to the point where service lifecycle issues such as version management are now paramount. However, there is a lack of versioning support in relevant standards and tools. We present an approach which leverages the existing WSDL service definition model to build a versioned service hosting solution. We distinguish between a web service interface (published) version and its implementation version (private). We introduce the concept of a service interface proxy. This proxy, which can be generated automatically, implicitly defines the service interface version, and is published as the logical service endpoint. Client requests are routed dynamically by the proxy to appropriate implementation versions. We have implemented a prototype of our approach to demonstrate its applicability.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10504,A Framework for Service Interoperability Analysis using Enterprise Architecture Models.,"Good IT decision making is a highly desirable property that can be furthered by the use of enterprise architecture, an approach to IT management using diagrammatic models. In order to support decision making, the models must be amenable to various kinds of analysis. It is desirable that the models support the sought after analysis effectively since creation of enterprise architecture models often is a demanding task. This paper suggests a framework for enterprise service interoperability analysis and a metamodel containing the information needed to perform the analysis. The paper also illustrates the use of the framework and metamodel in a fictional example.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10507,Verification of Privacy Timed Properties in Web Service Protocols.,"In this work we propose an approach for verifying privacy timed-related properties of web service protocol. While in \cite{anal} the addressed problem in business protocols is focused on the analysis and management of functional requirements that support rich timing constraints, our approach extends the previous results to capture the timed behavior of privacy constraints. Hence, we provide a model called Timed Private Business Protocol $\mathcal{TPBP}$. Next, we emphasize the timed properties related to privacy in $\mathcal{TPBP}$. Finally, we present the different types of timed property verification to achieve upon the timed private business protocol.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10508,A Graphical Approach to Providing Infrastructure Recommendations for IT.,"We present SPIRIT, a {\bf \emph{S}}ervice for {\bf \emph{P}}roviding {\bf \emph{I}}nfrastructure {\bf \emph{R}}ecommendations for {\bf \emph{I}}nformation {\bf \emph{T}}echnology. SPIRIT allows maintenance support providers for Small-to-Medium Businesses (SMBs) to recommend solutions which are standardized (SMBs usually cannot afford customized IT solutions), flexible (accommodating as much as possible the customer's existing IT environment), and cost-effective (minimizing the cost of upgrading the customer's environment). SPIRIT works by first aligning the customer's IT infrastructure with a ""template"" describing the best practices recommended by the maintenance support provider. This step is done using an efficient graph algorithm that finds the most cost-effective transformations of the customer's environment that are consistent with the template. Then the aligned environment can be upgraded by choosing from a standard set of well understood, highly automated (and therefore economical) options. We show that the algorithm performs well on both real and synthetic data.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10513,iFAO: Spatial Decision Support Services for Facility Network Transformation.,"Facility Network Transformation (FNT) is a strategic approach involving assessing and optimizing the industrial facility networks such as new site selection, demand forecasting, performance evaluation in banking, retailing, etc. In practice, FNT requirements are often diverse, dynamic and industry specific, it's often difficult to implement a generic FNT service fully integrated with legacy systems. The heterogeneity of spatial information further calls for a loosely coupled architecture. An innovative spatial decision support system, iFAO (Intelligent Facility Network Analytics and Optimization), is therefore developed based on Service Oriented Architecture for FNT problems. In this paper, key FNT service patterns are identified and modeled to develop an industrial independent solution, and an SOA-based framework for iFAO is proposed correspondingly. Implementation of iFAO services is presented with a Model-Driven approach. With a real case in banking, it's illustrated how the SOA based iFAO services are integrated to solve the real industrial problems, especially for quick decisions on business strategy in the competitive and ever-changing marketplaces.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10516,A Situations & Goals Semantic Model for Designing and Implementing Semantic Web Services-based Processes.,"The use of Semantic Web Services (SWS) increases the agility and adaptability of process execution in many settings. On the basis of available semantic descriptions, SWS allow the automatic selection,composition and mediation of the most adequate Web services to accomplish a specific process activity. However, we claim the need of a comprehensive semantic layer to cope with process, activity and domain-concept descriptions, beyond the scope of current SWS technologies. Therefore, we propose a semantic model that provides a starting point for the design and implementation of SWS-based processes across different settings and applications. The proposed Situations & Goals (S&G) Semantic Modelbases on a user-centric view of processes. Particularly, the following main elements have been identified: situations define the possible states of the world; situation descriptions capture, from a user perspective, the context in a particular situation; goals link between a situation and the following and are defined in terms of initial and target situation descriptions. The S&G semantic model is the epistemological core of a Situation Driven Processes (SDP) Ontology, which defines a general pattern for representing processes and can be derived for concrete settings and applications. As a result, Web applications can exploit the knowledge captured by the model to opportunely invoke SWS and thus address adaptive and flexible process executions.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

The proposed system will visualize positioning of companies in an industry. The positioning analysis shows the company priority issues in changing market. Conventionally, such information is collected and regenerated manually by analysts. Our technique retrieves RSS or web news, applies characteristic analysis for each sentence in the content, evaluates the sentences with business rules, and performs macro analysis based on the Five Forces analysis. This technique will grasp competitive powers of companies in the specific industry and will discover the differentiation factors of the company. The authors apply the proposed system to the optical network industry, and the system revealed that rivalry among the existing competitors was the most influential force in the industry.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10519,National Population Information System Based on Web Services.,"To address the issue of isolated information island in national population information system, we present a kind of multi-layers hierarchical service-oriented architecture. In the architecture, the top nodes are only the requestors of web services, and all the leaf nodes of the bottom layer are only the providers of web services. For those nodes of intermediate layers, every node is not only the provider of web services, but also the dispatcher of web services. All isolated information islands are connected by web services dispatcher and web services registry database to form a uniform collaborative system. The command (web service invocation) is recursively multicasted from top layer to bottom layer and statistical result data are gathered from bottom layer to top layer. We implement service integration, information integration and information sharing of national population information system.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10520,A Method for Service Center Architecture Based on Industry Standards.,"Component Business Modeling (CBM) designs a framework for defining non-overlapping, independent, reusable, cost-effective business components or service centers that provide business services. CBM is gaining broad acceptance in today's marketplace. On the other hand, compliance with industry standards is becoming an imperative in today's enterprises. We propose a bottom-up method for deriving business components from industry standards, based on the artifact-centric approach. In a climate of constant and unpredictable change, alignment between service centers and industry standards becomes essential to the success of enterprises.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10521,A Software as a Service with Multi-tenancy Support for an Electronic Contract Management Application.,"In most commercial electronic contract management applications available today, different customized code base has to be developed, deployed and operated to support each tenant. Few advanced commercial electronic contract management applications use a single code base with configuration options to support multi-tenants. However, a separate instance of the code base still has to be deployed and operated for each tenant even in these applications. The business model of having to support a single application instance for each tenant makes an electronic contract management application and other critical business applications out of reach for most small and medium businesses (SMBs), in particular, the very small businesses (SVBs) because of its high development and maintenance cost. Recently, a new business model of a single application instance supporting multi-tenancy based on Software as a Service (SaaS) has emerged making expensive business applications more affordable for SMBs and SVBs for multi-tenancy [1]. In this paper, we present the first of a kind multi-tenancy SaaS electronic contract management application. We also describe several novel methods used in the metadata, security and shared services, as well as customization and tenant extensions modules to support multi-tenancy SaaS in this application. This multi-tenancy SaaS application has shown to benefit both the application service providers as well as their tenants. This new multi-tenancy SaaS model can reduce the application hosting cost and make the application more affordable to the tenants because of its capabilities in customization and scalability while continuing to support an increasing number of tenants. It furthers benefits tenants by saving their money and time with immediate access to the latest IT innovations and infrastructure improvements on a single application code base. Most end users of tenants have found their productivities increased, the contract transaction time accelerated, contractual errors reduced in using this multi-tenancy SaaS electronic contract management application as demonstrated in several ongoing IBM pilot programs serving more than ten tenants with over 3000 end users.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10522,A Conflict Neighbouring Negotiation Algorithm for Resource Services in Dynamic Collaborations.,"Dynamic collaborations are the means by which a group of autonomous entities collaborate to achieve common objectives through sharing their own resources (e.g. specialised applications, controlled information and data, and storage and networking infrastructures). With the emergence of ""Cloud Computing"", it is now possible to share such resources as services. However, sharing such resource services requires that the participants agree to the terms and conditions of their responsibilities, as well as access to information and policies regulating their behaviour within the collaboration. This is done through the use of an eContract that captures the contributed resource-oriented services, as well as their respective service level agreements. One of the unique characteristics of the contract in dynamic collaborations is that each autonomous participant must agree with the services contributed by other participants against a set of its own policies. Within this context, this paper presents an efficient contract negotiation algorithm, called Conflict Neighbouring Algorithm (CNA). We model and verify the algorithm using SPIN model checker, and compare its performance results with other alternative algorithms.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10523,A Practical Geographic Ontology for Spatial Web Services.,"The application of ontology in Web services context for dynamic discovery, autonomous composition, invocation and monitoring has been deemed as very promising in semantic Web based enterprise application integration and m-commerce. There are many initiatives aiming to realize pervasive services to enable effective enactment of better quality of services, such as sensitiveness on service locations. The traditional WSDL is hardly qualified enough to tackle new challenges such as accurate representation of the non-functional properties of services. Hence, OWL-S came up with an effectual approach to facilitating semantic service description, dynamic composition, on-the-fly execution, and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a practical geographic ontology based on Geography Markup Language (GML) and extend OWL-S profile to formulate new geographic profiles. We also discuss specific scenarios where context-aware services invocation peers, which are advertised and coordinated via a newly designed GeoProfile, can be equipped with geographic information inherently to distinguish different peers.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Nowadays, it is recognized as one of significant intangible business assets to achieve competitive advantages. This research introduces a novel approach of business process analysis, which has more and more significance as process-aware information systems are spreading widely over a lot of companies. In this paper, a methodology of business process clustering based on process similarity is illustrated. The purpose of business process clustering is to analyze accumulated process models in order to assist design of new processes and reengineering of existing ones. The proposed methodology exploits structural similarity metrics of business processes. The methodology is illustrated with synthetic process models of insurance processes.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10525,Toward Web Service Dependency Discovery for SOA Management.,"The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has become today's reference architecture for modern distributed systems. As SOA concepts and technologies become more and more widespread and the number of services in operation within enterprises increases, the problem of managing these services becomes manifest. One of the most pressing needs we hear from customers is the ability to ""discover"", within a maze of services each offering functionality to (and in turn using functionality offered by) other services, which are the actual dependencies between such services. Understanding dependencies is essential to performing two functions: impact analysis (understanding which other services are affected when a service becomes unavailable) and service-level root-cause analysis (which is the opposite problem: under-standing the causes of a service failure by looking at the other services it relies on). Discovering dependencies is essential as the hope that the enterprise maintains documentation that describe these dependencies (on top of a complex maze and evolving implementations) is vane. Hence, we have to look for dependencies by observing and analyzing the interactions among services. In this paper we identify the importance of the problem of discovering dynamic dependencies among Web services and we propose a solution for the automatic identification of traces of dependent messages, based on the correlation of messages exchanged among services. We also discuss our lessons learned and results from applying the techniques to data related to HP processes and services.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10526,A Formal Model of Service Delivery.,"We define a service delivery system as a set of interacting entities that are involved in the delivery of one or more business services. A service operating system manages the processes and resources within a service delivery system. This paper presents our on-going work on developing a formal model for these concepts, with the goal of clearly and precisely describing the delivery behavior of service systems. The model lays the groundwork for reasoning about the scenarios that occur in service delivery.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10528,A Formal Model for Channel Passing in Web Service Composition.,"Despite the importance for expressing location mobility and dynamic composition, channel passing has almost been ignored in the formal work on Web service composition. One important problem here is to ensure that each service in a composition can always get sufficient and correct channels for completing their collaborative work. To support reasoning and verification of those properties of service compositions, in this paper we propose a pair of formal languages that support channel passing on both global and local levels, together with their semantics. Also we present a top-down design methodology that generates local-level processes from global description, and prove that the generated processes must be deadlock-free under the sufficient conditions we proposed.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10529,A Framework for Model-Based Continuous Improvement of Global IT Service Delivery Operations.,"In recent years, the ability to deliver IT infrastructure services from multiple geographically distributed locations has given rise to an entirely new IT services business model. In this model, called the ""Global Delivery Model"", clients out source components of their IT infrastructure operations to multiple service providers, who in turn use a combination of onsite and offsite (including offshore) resources to manage the components on behalf of their clients. Since the components of services provided can be assembled and processed at any of the delivery centers, a framework for continuous monitoring of quality and productivity of the delivery processes is essential to pinpoint and remedy potential process inefficiencies. In this paper, we describe a framework implemented by a large global service provider that uses continuous monitoring and process behavior charts to detect any potential shifts in its global ITservice delivery environment. Using this framework, the service provider has already improved several of its IT delivery processes resulting in improved quality and productivity. We discuss the major components of the framework, challenges in deploying such a system for global processes whose lifecycle spans multiple delivery centers, and present examples of process improvements that resulted from deploying the framework.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

This paper considers an inventory control problem with multiple-period replenishment lead time and nonstationary stochastic demand, and provides an optimal policy for this kind of problem. The problem is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming model, then a solution algorithm which can obtain the optimal solution is developed. Numerical comparisons verify the effectiveness of the proposed policy.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10533,Ensuring Service Level Agreements for Service Workflows.,"Specifying and monitoring Service Level Agreements (SLA) has been the subject of intensive research. However, methods of enforcing SLA have not addressed the specific issues of Composite Services (CS). Our work focuses on the problem of keeping prearranged SLAs for service workflows including workflows supporting long lived transactions (e.g. WS-BA). As a solution we offer scheduling of component service requests. The latter is based on regaining control over legacy services by means of transparent proxies and later scheduling of their invocations. Various heuristics based policies are evaluated under two different types of Service Level Agreements. The policies vary from the simpler, operating only on the base of business value, to the more complex which also consider Quality of Service requirements, topologies of workflows, utilization of components services, etc. The experiments conducted over the model, which precisely captures the behavior of web services, reveal the benefits of providing schedulers with various types of context.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10534,A Policy Distribution Service for Proactive Fraud Management over Financial Data Streams.,"With the ever-increasing number of unmanned customer interaction channels (e.g. internet and mobile banking), financial platforms are becoming subject to an expanding collection of system attacks due to their unique potential for large scale monetary theft. Significant challenge therefore remains in keeping fraud policy repositories current to prevent financial loss and customer inconvenience, due to the rapid rate at which fraudsters re-engineer their methods and deploy new system attacks. Accordingly, fraud policy development based upon mining of an institution's transactional data provides only an isolated view of industry behaviour with no support for the exchange of fraud policy data with other institutions that are likely to experience similar behavioural attacks as fraudsters horizontally permeate their efforts through analogous sector organisations. This paper proposes a Policy Distribution Service for the automated collection, analysis and distribution of emerging fraud policy definitions through a collaborative policy sharing model. A key aspect of the service is the creation of an industry wide policy knowledge base within a centralised mediator component and distribution of policies using a common modelling formalism which maybe mapped into multiple disparate target fraud management implementations.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10535,A Two Stage Heuristic Algorithm for Solving the Server Consolidation Problem with Item-Item and Bin-Item Incompatibility Constraints.,"The problem of server sprawl is common in data centers of most business organizations. It is most often the case that an application is run on dedicated servers. This leads to situations where organizations end up having numerous servers that remain under-utilized most of the times. The servers, in such scenarios, are allocated more resources (disk, cpu and memory) than are justified by their present workloads. Consolidating multiple under-utilized servers into a fewer number of non-dedicated servers that can host multiple applications is an effective tool for businesses to enhance their returns on investment. The problem can be modeled as a variant of the bin packing problem where items to be packed are the servers being consolidated and bins are the target servers. The sizes of the servers/items being packed are resource utilizations which are obtained from the performance trace data. Here we describe a novel two stage heuristic algorithm for taking care of the ""bin-item"" incompatibility constraints that are inherent in any server consolidation problem. The model is able to solve extremely large instances of problem in a reasonable amount of time.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10537,Optimum Decentralized Choreography for Web Services Composition.,"Typical solutions for Web services composition problem develop a single intermediary which mediates or choreographs computation and communication among the existing services to realize a target/goal service. However, such a centralized choreography mechanism can involve communication/computation overhead that can be reduced through its decentralized realization. With this as motivation, we study the problem of synthesizing a decentralized choreography strategy that will have an optimum overhead for service composition by developing a set of site-specific choreographers working concurrently to implement a desired goal service. Each communication/computation is quantified by a cost. We develop an algorithm that takes as input the existing services, the goal service, the costs and produces as an output a set of site-specific choreographers that optimally realize the goal service using the existing services. The contribution lies in the formulation of the optimal decentralized choreographer synthesis problem as well as its solution and extends our earlier work in two ways: decentralization of solution and its optimality.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

We have implemented a prototype application for stroke therapy which reduces the time from patient arrival to CT scan by 43%, and the time from arrival to treatment by 48% respectively. Our system can perform context-based CT image retrieval and allows images to be reviewed on mobile devices. Context-based QoS adaptation has been shown to reduce the transmission time required to transmit 619 brain images to mobile devices from 1336 seconds to 106 seconds. The system utilizes medical information standards, including DICOM and HL7.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10540,Representing and Accessing Design Knowledge for Service Integration.,"Process construction from existing services requires use of appropriate design knowledge. For services that are mapped to underlying legacy applications, this takes the form of enterprise integration solutions. Design knowledge in this domain is available in the form of Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP). These patterns are, however, difficult to understand; they also use primitives that are different from those used for process representation. As a result, accessing EIP based on process requirements remains a cognitively demanding task for designers. In this paper, we describe a knowledge-base that represents the EIPs, infusing them with semantics derived from speech acts; and a set of heuristics, which can be used to retrieve EIPs for a set of requirements. An example serves to illustrate how the two can work in tandem to assist the designer.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10541,Experimental Robustness Evaluation of JMS Middleware.,"The use of Java Message Service (JMS) for enterprise applications communication and integration is increasing very quickly. However, although JMS is frequently used in business-critical environments, applications are typically developed with the assumption that the middleware being used is robust, which is not always the case. Robustness failures in such environments are particularly dangerous, as they may originate vulnerabilities that can be maliciously exploited with severe consequences for the systems subject of attack. This paper proposes an approach for the evaluation of the robustness of JMS middleware. Our approach is presented through a concrete example of evaluating the robustness of three well-known JMS solutions (JBoss MQ 3.2.8.SP1, JBoss MQ 4.2.1.GA, and Active MQ 4.1.1), in which several robustness and critical security related problems have been disclosed (including specification conformance disparities).",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10542,An Incremental Graph-based Approach to Automatic Service Composition.,"In the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm services are self-contained software units of functionality. Several services can be composed to assemble a composite service that provides an overall functionality. This process is called Service Composition. The automation of the service composition process aims at decreasing the human intervention during the service discovery, matching, ranking, filtering and reasoning about the resulting composition candidates. The paper presents an innovative approach to automatic service composition. The discovery and matchmaking is based on semantic annotations of service properties, e.g. their inputs, outputs and goals. The approach uses a graph-based search algorithm to determine all possible composition candidates and applies certain measures to rank them. Filtering and reasoning is accomplished by validating the composition candidates using goal-based expressions.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10543,Variation-Oriented Engineering (VOE): Enhancing Reusability of SOA-based Solutions.,"Software service organizations typically develop custom solutions from scratch in each project engagement. This is not a scalable proposition, since it depends too heavily on labor alone. Rather, creating and reusing software ""assets"" is more scalable and profitable. One prevalent approach to building software solutions is to use service-oriented architecture (SOA) to compose software services to support business processes. In this context, the key to reusing assets is to support the right mechanisms to incrementally refine existing software services as well as business processes. In this paper, we propose a set of mechanisms called Variation-Oriented Engineering (VOE) to support this incremental refinement. VOE is a comprehensive formal approach for modeling end-to-end variability in SOA-based solutions for the purpose of enhancing reusability. We illustrate our approach on a realistic example from the insurance domain, via a prototype implementation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10544,Locating Components Realizing Services in Existing Systems.,"Organizations adopting Service Oriented Architecture can derive higher business value only if the functionality provided by existing systems is reused. ""Servicising"" existing systems (locating and exposing available functionality as a set of service based operations), is an efficient way forward, to the evolution of existing systems to SOA. To facilitate the location of service(s) already implemented in the systems, a helpful step is to locate components that realize the required functionality. In this paper, a static and semi-automatic approach to locating components realizing service is proposed. The approach consists of three steps: retrieval of links between a service and the components in the source code, filtering of links using static structural analysis and finally categorizing them as functional and technical components. The results of the approach applied to two open source systems are presented. The results indicate that the approach is quite effective in identifying the links between the service descriptions and source code components and categorizing them into functional and technical components.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10545,Verification of Access Control Requirements in Web Services Choreography.,"Web services choreography is used to design peer-to-peer applications where each peer is potentially a Web service. It defines the required behavior of participating Web services along with their interactions through message exchanges. Implementing a complex system described by a choreography requires selecting actual Web services whose individual behaviors are compatible with the overall behavior described by the choreography. Although the selected Web services implement the specified behavior, they may not be able to interact due to the policies they enforce to protect their resources. A Web service' resource can be an operation or a credential type to be submitted to be able to invoke an operation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to determine at design time whether a choreography can be implemented by a set of Web services based on their access control policies and the disclosure policies regulating the release of their credentials. We model both Web services and Web services choreography as transition systems and represent Web services credential disclosure policies as directed graphs. We then verify that all possible conversations of the Web services choreography can be implemented by matching credential disclosure policies of the invoker Web service with the access control policy of the Web services being invoked. We propose a resource release graph to enable this verification.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10546,A Folksonomy-Based Model of Web Services for Discovery and Automatic Composition.,"In this paper, we propose a novel way of modeling web services using folksonomies. The key advantage of our model is that it allows a large number of users to participate, easily, in annotating services with tags. This is in contrast to more expressive, logic based models of services, such as Semantic Web Service models, which require significant expertise for annotation and maintenance. Our folksonomy-based model allows associating semantic constraints on the input and output messages of web service operations using tags obtained from a folksonomy. We show how the model can be used for discovery and composition of services. We also describe a planner that uses this model to compose services and create workflows, automatically. We present performance results for the planner and our experiences in using this model in a sample real-world domain.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,

10548,SCOOP: Automated Social Recommendation in Enterprise Process Management.,"The interplay between labor arbitrage and consistent service delivery in IT outsourcing continues to drive business process standardization. New emerging standards, like ITIL, is defining an industry-wide taxonomy for IT service management. These standards are often at a high level and require substantial investment from service providers to define and implement these standards across the various low-level processes they offer. This paper presents a process management system, called Cyano, that uses social networks and recommendation to greatly increase the effectiveness of process capture and knowledge maintenance. We particularly focus on Cyano's social recommendation engine, called SCOOP, which utilizes the intrinsic graph property of process content for recommendation. More specifically, SCOOP maintains a user-process interaction graph Gand computes the user-to-user similarity scores using the random walk with restart on G. Finally, we evaluate SCOOP in the context of a large-scale deployment of Cyano, with thousands of processes and users.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10549,Predicting Service Mashup Candidates Using Enhanced Syntactical Message Management.,"The descriptiveness of capabilities advertised on service-oriented architectures provides a promising platform for crafting new knowledge. Service mashup has been introduced as an approach for integrating the information provided from multiple web services into one common operational picture. In the future, scale will be a barrier to these types of approaches. With the entry and exit of large numbers of services on the Internet, it will be difficult to find and suggest the most relevant service candidates for new mashups. In this work, we present an efficient syntactical approach for actively discovering web service candidates for service mashups. This approach leverages the message naming characteristics of the developers and of the target service repository to inform search algorithms. Favorable precision results are described based on experimentation executed on an open repository of web service from the Internet.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10550,End-to-End Versioning Support for Web Services.,"Software services are, just like any other software system, subject to permanent change. We argue that these changes should generally be transparent to service consumers. However, currently consumers are often tied to a given version of a service and have no means of easily upgrading to a newer version. In this paper we propose a WSDL-driven classification of Web service change types and discuss a versioning mechanism for service-oriented systems that considers revision management on registry- and client-side. We use the concepts of service version graphs and selection strategies to provide transparent end-to-end versioning support, and show how this approach is implemented in our service-oriented computing runtime VRESCo. Furthermore, we illustrate the advantages of our approach in comparison to the current state of the art using a realistic case study.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10551,Adaptive Secure Access to Remote Services.,"Since the inception of service-oriented computing paradigm, we have witnessed a plethora of services deployed across a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from conventional RPC-based services to SOAP-based Web services. Likewise, the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled the remote ""on the move"" access of these services from anywhere at any time. Secure access to these services is challenging especially in a mobile computing environment with heterogeneous modalities. Conventional static access control mechanisms are not able to accommodate complex secure access requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive secure access mechanism to address this problem. Our mechanism, which consists of two components: an adaptive access control module and an adaptive function invocation module, not only adapts access control policies to diverse requirements, but also introduces function invocation adaptation during access. We have successfully applied the proposed adaptive secure access mechanism to a computer-assisted surgery application called UbiCAS. Performance evaluation shows that with limited overhead, our technique enforces secure access to the services provided by the UbiCAS system in a flexible way.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10552,Incomplete Preference-driven Web Service Selection.,"Selecting services from those available according to user preferences plays a important role in Web services composition. Current solutions for service selection focus on selecting services quantitatively. In many domains it is desirable to assess such preference in a qualitative rather than quantitative way. Furthermore, in many practical situations, if the user is reluctant to provide complete preference information or to totally order the values of each attributes in every possible context, it is natural to ask how to model in these incompletely specified cases. This paper uses a qualitative graphical representation tool, called CP-nets, to describe qualitative preference relations in a relatively compact, intuitive, and structured manner under conditional ceteris paribus (all else being equal) preference statements. Our goal is to select the optimal set of services available according to user preference with this technique. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of this approach.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10553,Instance Isolation Analysis for Service-Oriented Architectures.,"When a service engages in multiple conversations concurrently, incoming messages must be correlated with messages previously sent or received. Languages such as BPEL incorporate correlation as first-class citizen. However, current verification and testing techniques for service implementations largely ignore possible correlation anomalies as they typically focus on isolated conversations. This paper defines the notion of instance isolation and shows how to check this property. For doing so it introduces v*-nets, a Petri net extension with name creation and name passing.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10554,Chord4S: A P2P-based Decentralised Service Discovery Approach.,"Service-oriented computing is emerging as a paradigm for developing distributed applications. A critical issue of utilising service-oriented computing is to have a scalable, reliable and robust service discovery mechanism. However, traditional service discovery methods using centralised registries can easily suffer from problems such as performance bottleneck and vulnerability to failures in the large scalable service network, thus functioning abnormally. To address these problems, this paper proposes a peer-to-peer based decentralised service discovery approach named Chord4S. Chord4S utilises the data distribution and lookup capabilities of the popular Chord to distribute and discover services in a decentralised manner. Data availability is further improved by distributing service descriptions of functionally-equivalent services to different successor nodes that are organised into a virtual segment in the Chord circle. In addition, the Chord routing protocol is extended to support efficient discovery of multiple services with single request. This enables late negotiation of service level agreements between a service consumer and multiple service providers. The experimental evaluation shows that Chord4S achieves higher data availability and provides efficient query with reasonable overhead.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10555,Optimal Resource Action Planning Analytics for Services Delivery Using Hiring Contracting & Cross-Training of Various Skills.,"We address the problem of optimal resource action planning, which is faced by firms in the services business in the context of planning delivery of services with an expected demand outlook for various skills. Firms have the option of cross-training a chosen number of resource-units from a primary skill type into secondary skills, tertiary skills, and so on. They have the option of further hiring and increasing the system availability of any chosen skill type. They also have the option of contracting out a required amount of any chosen skill type. We address the problem of identifying the optimal set of planned resource control actions, in terms of both the timing and extent of hiring, cross-training, and contracting combination, so that they are well positioned to meet the actual demand. We present a mathematical model that can be described in terms of a constrained network flow and map it to a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The model considers practical constraints such as minimum residence time that a resource unit needs to spend in a skill-type into which it gets cross-trained or hired, minimum acceptable contracting duration for a contracted skill type, first order and higher orders of cross-training for a skill type, with lead-times, logical business rules associated with cross-training transfer sequences, as well as firm-specific targets on service levels and resource utilization, in determining the optimal resource action plan.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10556,A Secure Information Flow Architecture for Web Services.,"Current web service platforms (WSPs) often perform all web services-related processing, including security-sensitive information handling, in the same protection domain. Consequently, the entire WSP may have access to security-sensitive information such as credit card numbers, forcing us to trust a large and complex piece of software. To address this problem, we propose ISO-WSP, a new information flow architecture that decomposes current WSPs into two parts executing in separate protection domains: (1) a small trusted T-WSP to handle security-sensitive data, and (2) a large, legacy untrusted U-WSP that provides the normal WSP functionality, but uses the T-WSP for security-sensitive data handling. By restricting security-sensitive data access to T-WSP, ISO-WSP reduces the software complexity of trusted code, thereby improving the testability of ISO-WSP. Using a prototype implementation based on the Apache Axis2 WSP, we show that ISO-WSP reduces software complexity of trusted components by a factor of five, while incurring a modest performance overhead of few milliseconds per request.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10557,Byzantine Fault Tolerant Coordination for Web Services Business Activities.,"In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the threats towards the coordination services for Web services business activities and explore the most optimal solution to mitigate such threats. A careful analysis of the state model of the coordination services reveals that it is sufficient to use a lightweight Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm that avoids performing expensive total ordering of all request messages. The algorithm and the associated mechanisms have been incorporated into an open-source framework implementing the standard Web services business activity specification and an extension protocol that enables the separation of the coordination tasks from the business logic. The performance evaluation results obtained using the working prototype confirm the optimality of our solution.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10558,Study of Service Processing Agent for Context-Aware Service Coordination.,"We proposed service processing agent which enables end-users to use context aware services easily. In ubiquitous network environments in the future, context-aware services are expected because the context-awareness is one of the most important factors in ubiquitous network. Therefore, the flexible service composition based on user context is required. Our proposed approach is that a service processing agent searches and selects suitable service components based on the user context and binds them dynamically. Users can send a request to the service processing agent in usual web service messaging. Through the study, implementation and performance measurement, we showed the effectiveness and practicality of our proposed method.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10559,Web Service Matching by Ontology Instance Categorization.,"Identifying similar Web services is becoming increasingly important to ensure the success of dynamically integrated Web-service-based applications. We propose a categorization-based scheme to match equivalent Web services that can operate on heterogeneous domain ontologies. Given the upper ontology for services and domain ontologies, our service matching scheme determines whether a given Web service is a possible replacement using a categorization utility called OnExCat. OnExCat categorizes ontology instances extracted from the service descriptions by a probabilistic categorization measurement that incorporates the concept relationships in the upper ontology for services. In addition to tackling the issue of heterogeneity of domain ontology in service descriptions using categorization, our matching scheme also adapts itself by enhancing the known ontologies with newly discovered ontology instances. Experiments on service matching using our matching scheme based on the OnExCat utility have been performed with promising results, a correct matching rate of over 85%.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10560,A 3-level e-Business Registry Meta Model.,"Business partners willing to do business electronically with each other must reach an agreement (1) on the economic level, (2) on the inter-organizational process choreography, and (3) on the services implementing the choreography. In order to search for a potential business partner, one will first look for a partner who offers a required service on the economic level and who supports a complementary role in a choreography, before binding to its IT services. In as much, a registry for inter-organizational systems should cover all three levels and maintain the dependencies between them. In this paper we set up on well accepted approaches on the different levels, i.e. (1) the e3value ontology, (2) the UN/CEFACT modeling methodology (UMM), and (3) the business process execution language (BPEL). We specify a registry meta model on top of ebRIM registering the artifacts on the different levels and defining their inter-dependencies.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10561,Promoting Reuse via Extraction of Domain Concepts and Service Abstractions from Design Diagrams.,"Systematic reuse of software artifacts has been an elusive goal for several years. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been touted in recent years due its promise of fostering reuse. Even so, reuse with SOA continues to be limited due to the lack of formal techniques for extracting domain knowledge from existing reusable software assets. In this paper,we present an approach that extracts the domain knowledge and service abstractions from design diagrams of existing software solutions and represents it in a form that can be reused in new projects. We have implemented our approach and preliminary results indicate that both domain knowledge and service abstraction thus extracted can promote reuse of software assets to a large extent.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10562,Monitoring Dependencies for SLAs: The MoDe4SLA Approach.,"In service oriented computing different techniques for monitoring Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are available. Many of these monitoring approaches focus on bilateral agreements between partners. However, when monitoring composite services it is not only important to figure out whether SLAs are violated, but we also need to analyze why these violations have occurred. When offering a composite service a company depends on its content providers to meet the service level they agreed upon. Due to these dependencies a company should not only monitor the SLA of the composite service, but also the SLAs of the services it depends on. By analyzing and monitoring the composite service in this way, causes for SLA violations can be easier found. In this paper we demonstrate how to analyze SLAs during development phase and how to monitor these dependencies using event logs during runtime. We call our approach MoDe4SLA (Monitoring Dependencies for SLAs).",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10563,A Risk Reduction Framework for Dynamic Workflows.,"Workflows tend to fail in real-world scenarios due to the uncertain/unreliable sensory information which sometimes needs to be updated during the execution of workflows. In a logic based framework, these dynamic predicates that can be updated are called non-monotonic predicates (NMPs). In this paper, we focus on reducing the risk of a given workflow due to the NMPs in that workflow. The main idea is to synthesize a backup workflow by augmenting the main workflow without introducing new NMPs. The backup workflow is generated by using expected values of NMPs if necessary instead of given values. The expected values are calculated from the execution history or provided by a domain expert. It is argued that total risk reduces to the square root of the main workflow itself.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10564,A Middleware Architecture for Enhancing Web Services Infrastructure for Distributed Coordination of Workflows.,"This paper discusses a layered workflow software architecture for distributed coordination of workflows over web services and proposes fundamental enhancements to the web services infrastructure that facilitate the layered workflow software architecture. We verify our layered approach using a detailed simulation and a proof-of-concept prototype implementation. Our proposed architecture for Web Service Coordination Management Middleware (WSCMM) is a simple but powerful enhancement to the web service infrastructure enabling the services to locally manage their dependencies and to handle messages resulting from multiple workflows. We have carried out a detailed simulation to identify key components of our middleware architecture. We also compare and contrast our architecture with the current web service technologies. Our experiments demonstrate that we can develop both centralized and distributed workflows over the architecturally enhanced web services with relative simplicity. In addition, our lightweight coordination components with footprint no larger than 150 KB allow these workflows to be executed even on a handheld.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10565,Optimizing Change Request Scheduling in IT Service Management.,"Enterprises of today face the challenge of managing large, complex IT eco-systems consisting of software applications, servers, network routers, and other type of resources. Change management, especially scheduling of changes, is known to be one of the most challenging problems in managing IT operations. In this paper, we propose an optimization model for IT change scheduling that takes into account the constraints and cost factors typically encountered in a service provider environment. In particular, we formulate the model in a way that can be solved using standard mathematical programming techniques (i.e., mixed integer programming). This not only results in strictly optimal solutions, but also provides a scalable means for scheduling a large set of change requests with complex constraints. Furthermore, having a computational efficient optimization solution facilitates the study of the scheduling sensitivity with respect to parameter inaccuracy and leads to more robust change schedules. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an IT change management example which is built using insights from a large service delivery account and over two hundred thousand change instances.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10566,Scaling Location-based Services with Dynamically Composed Location Index.,"Performance and scalability of location-based services (LBSs) are crucial to the wide deployment of mobile enterprise systems. Location queries are a fundamental capability of LBSs. Conventional approaches to location query processing have been centered on an object-centric architecture where static and moving objects are processed under a unified framework through an object index or query index. In this paper, we identify and exploit the performance benefit of a location-centric framework by promoting a clean separation of location query processing over static objects from query processing over moving objects. We show the performance benefits of treating locations as first class citizens instead of objects. Concretely, we develop a federated location indexing scheme for processing location queries over static objects and maintain a grid-based object index for processing queries over moving objects. Our experimental results demonstrate that the location-centric framework enables highly efficient processing of different types of location queries in a mobile environment, prevails under all types of query workloads compared to the object-centric approaches, and in some scenarios it requires as low as only 6% of the IOs required by a corresponding object index for query evaluation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10567,Rapid Deployment of SOA Solutions via Automated Image Replication and Reconfiguration.,"Deployment is an important aspect of software solutions' life-cycle and is repeatedly employed at many stages including development, testing, delivery, and demonstration. Traditional script-based approaches for deployment are primarily manual and hence error prone, resulting in wasted time and labor. In this paper we propose a framework and approach for faster redeployment of distributed software solutions. In our approach the solution is first deployed on virtual machines using traditional methods. Then environment dependent configurations of the solution are discovered and preserved along with the images of virtual machines. For subsequent deployments, the preserved images are provisioned, and the deployer is provided an opportunity to change a subset of the recorded configurations that cannot be automatically derived e.g. IP addresses, ports. The remaining recorded configurations are derived by executing meta-model level constraints on the solution configuration model. Finally, the virtual machines are updated with new configurations by leveraging the semantics of appropriate scripts. Our framework allows product experts to describe the configuration meta-model, constraints, and script semantics. This product knowledge is specified only once, and is reused across solutions for automatic configuration discovery and re-configuration. We demonstrate with case studies that our approach reduces the time for repeated deployments of a solution from an order of weeks to an order of hours.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10568,An Automatic Semantic Segment Detection Service for HTML Documents.,"To facilitate wide adoption of wireless devices for Internet access, it is important to enable the ""develop once and use everywhere"" trademark. This means that a Web page can be developed in HTML for presentation on desktop machines, and then be automatically adapted and displayed on any device including handheld devices. In this paper, we propose a mediator Web service that automatically adapts Web content into suitable formats based on receiving contexts. Our underpinning is a hierarchical semantic meta model and a semantic ontology that guide in partitioning a Web page into semantic segments, which refer to atomic units encapsulating one or more of the four types of semantically coherent elements in a content page: function (functionality related), typesetting (readability related), presentation relationship (space and time related), and literary context (semantics related). We also report our experiences in designing and implementing the mediator service. Our experimental results demonstrate that our service is effective and efficient in automatically transforming Web content into semantic-retained formats suitable to be displayed on handheld devices.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10569,A Graph Theory Based Impact and Completion Analysis Framework and Applications for Modeling SOA Solution Components.,"Evolved from our engineering experience, this paper presents a mathematical framework to define and analyze an SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) model. SOA model, composed by design elements, is represented as directed graph based on graph theory. For each design element, two directed graphs are created to reflect the panoramic view and relationships of this design element with other design elements of same model, and used for impact and completion analysis of this design element. A numerical value called the relative importance indicator is computed to quantify the relationship between any two design elements. This indicator forms a matrix that is used as a base for more advanced analysis, such as model partition, model coupling, and variation-oriented design. Some future research directions such as model reduction are discussed at the end of this paper.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10570,PASS: An Approach to Personalized Automated Service Composition.,"With the rapid development of SOC (Service oriented computing), the automated service composition has become an important research direction. Through automated service composition, business processes need not to be constructed in advance, which helps to improve the flexibility of service composition. The current research on automated service composition is mainly based on AI techniques, and a common domain-oriented knowledge base is usually required to perform the heuristic planning. In practice, it is impossible for the knowledge base to characterize the personalized requirements of different users, so the AI-based methods can not apply to the user-centric application scenarios. In this paper, we propose PASS, a novel approach to personalized automated service composition. With PASS, both the hard-constraints represented by user's initial state, and the soft-constraints represented by user preferences can be satisfied in the process of automated service composition. Furthermore, three algorithms are designed to implement preference-aware automated service composition. In these algorithms, the Pareto dominance principle and relaxation degree are used to select the most satisfied composite service for users. Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10571,A User-Steering Exploratory Service Composition Approach.,"Service orchestration logics can be difficult to be totally pre-fabricated when facing uncertain requirements. It is sometimes indispensable to get end users involved. However, there are some requirements: 1)Allow users to express their desired goals incrementally. 2)Allow users to specify key trajectory constraints. 3)Provide intelligent assistance to users in the composition. Intuitively we propose a user-steering explorative service composition approach that can support extended goals. It gives users more control and facilitates incremental development by suggesting candidate paths. During the generation of candidate paths, we use heuristics to find better plan paths, then guide users to gradually progress towards the goal. The proposed approach is verified in a typical bioinformatics scenario. The preliminary experiment results show that the approach can improve the efficiency and timelyness of service composition.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10572,Formalising Message Exchange Patterns using BPEL Light.,"In a message-driven SOA, message exchange patterns (MEPs) define a reusable notion of conversational contracts between a service consumer and a service provider from the provider's point of view. They enable a common understanding regarding a message flow between both parties. In contrast to version 1.1 of the Web Service Description Language (WSDL) the current version 2.0 has introduced a template for defining such patterns that allows to define and reference patterns beyond the standard input/output ones defined in the specification. Although reasonable, this approach brings several disadvantages which we point out in this paper. Since WSDL 2.0 MEPs and WS-BPEL processes describe interaction behaviour from the same perspective BPEL makes a perfect candidate as a language for formalising MEPs, especially because it provides a powerful mechanism for describing control flow and correlation of related messages. In this work we propose a way to formalising MEPs using a WSDL-less BPEL dialect called BPEL light. We introduce a new abstract BPEL profile for defining reusable and machine-readable MEPs that is capable of expressing arbitrary message exchanges. With this approach we pave the way for more flexible interaction styles and reduce the impedance mismatch between imperative programming and message orientation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10573,A QSQL-based Efficient Planning Algorithm for Fully-automated Service Composition in Dynamic Service Environments.,"Web service composition is emerging as a promising technology for supporting large-scale, sophisticated business process integration in a variety of complex e-science or e-business domains. Particularly, semantics have been proposed as a key to automatically solving the discovery and composition problem. However, most of semantic composition approaches still remain at a stage of low efficiency because of the performance issues brought by the involved ontology reasoning and manual processing. To address this problem, in this paper, we present a QSQL-based service composition algorithm towards a fully-automated service composition. QSQL (Quick Service Query List) is an efficient service query index list which can achieve about the same semantic service discovery effects as other existing semantic composition methods, but with much less reasoning. With our proposed QSQL-based service composition algorithm, composition plans can be created to meet a user's query in an automatic, efficient and semantic manner. In particular, with our algorithm, most existing composition plans in QSQL can be founded and ranked by exploiting a weighted Petri net representation; which will facilitate the execution verification. The final experiment is conducted to further demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed composition approach and its efficiency.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10574,Security Specification at Process Level.,"In this paper, we present a process-oriented tool allowing the specification of security properties at the service composition level. The tool is based on the notions of abstract and concrete services as well as on the concept of separation of concerns. It provides a framework that allows different people to effectively discuss security issues. Abstract services can be viewed as activities rather than as technical services and are such better understood by non-technical people. Similarly, security is discussed in terms of needs and no complex security technologies are to be specified. The tool relies between these two meta-models specifying orchestration-related concepts and security concepts. Meta-links between the meta-models have been defined to specify the authorized security constraints on the orchestrated services. The tool has been validated on an application specified by Thales.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10575,Towards Effective Project Management across Multiple Projects with Distributed Performing Centers.,"Software service providers develop custom solutions to meet their customers' requirements. Large customers can typically contract out multiple projects to the same vendor which run the projects assigned to them simultaneously. Large providers are increasingly using a distributed/ global model for software development (delivery) wherein they can leverage the skills and cost-advantages of different sites to deliver the projects effectively and efficiently, for which project coordination with accurate information is of central importance. In this paper, we highlight the challenges in effective project coordination for a customer across multiple projects with distributed performing centers. This situation is not addressed by current project manage mentor software development tools. The nature of the problem requires standardized metadata, schedule and resource management, and measurements for project monitoring. We propose a framework for global project management and governance to addresses the identified challenges which also takes current project tools into perspective. Our approach extensively leverages historical data gathered on metrics pertaining to different types of work requests.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10576,Service Functionality Indexing and Matching for Service-Based Systems.,"In service-based systems, one of the most basic requirements for service matching is to find services with functionalities similar to the expected functionality of a given service discovery request. In this paper, a functionality-compatibility-based service indexing and matching approach is presented. This approach indexes a set of services using functionality-compatibility defined on their parameters and conditions, and filters the indexed services to identify those with compatible functionalities to the service discovery request efficiently. This approach is evaluated to show the effectiveness and efficiency.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10577,Towards a SLA-based Approach to Handle Service Disruptions.,"Service-orientation enables cooperation between multiple organizations and has become a solution of choice to tackle the complexity of ubiquitous computing. The very nature of ubiquitous applications implies a need for dynamic solutions. Service oriented computing provides support for these dynamic applications. However, current solutions overlook important aspects, particularly when dynamically substituting services. Some applications may be mission-critical and therefore the disruption of a particular service could be harmful. Otherapplications may tolerate the disappearance of a service if the service returns within a predefined amount of time. Hence, guarantees regarding availability of services that compose an application are required. In this paper we propose to take into account service disruptions through service level agreements for dynamic service-oriented applications.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10578,Zazen: A Mediating SOA between Ajax Applications and Enterprise Data.,"One reason that enterprises are adopting service-oriented architectures (SOA) is to develop applications more quickly by packaging â€“ and then reusing â€“ applications and data assets as services. Service encapsulation of implementation details is an important feature, and contributes to the loosely-coupled nature of a SOA. From this perspective, SOA data-services seem incompatible with AJAX frameworks which presume a great degree of client-side control of an application's data. For their part, AJAX frameworks promise to increase web-application performance by reducing the number of interactions between the browser and server. Caching server data on the web-client is a well known technique for achieving this goal, but implies that enterprise data is exposed to client-side developers. This paper presents ZAZEN, a SOA that mediates between the need to encapsulate enterprise data as a service and the needs of AJAX developers who want more control of their application's data. We describe ZAZEN's server-side architecture and discuss two APIs to the data-service: a REST API, and an implementation of the DOJO data APIs for relational databases.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10579,Leveraging Service Composition Relationship to Improve CPU Demand Estimation in SOA Environments.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) helps dynamically construct composite services out of a set of low-level atomic services to satisfy customer requirements. For the purpose of capacity planning and resource provisioning, it is important to understand these services' demand for system resources, e.g., CPU. In this paper, we propose a black-box method for estimating CPU demand of service requests based on linear regression between the observed request throughput and resource utilization level. A key advantage of our method is that its input data (i.e., request-processing throughput and resource utilization) can be easily obtained without intrusive software instrumentation. Moreover, we observe that, in an SOA environment, the service composition relationship (i.e., how low-level atomic services are connected into a composite service) is either known in advance or can be discovered through various means. We leverage this composition relationship to further improve the quality of CPU demand estimation. By analyzing the dependency between a composite service and its constituent low-level atomic services using linear algebra, our method can eliminate the collinear problem introduced by the service composition relationship. Moreover, our method can further reduce the number of unknown variables in the linear regression problem, and hence reduce the time duration needed to collect input data. In a dynamic SOA environment, this translates into faster response to changing workloads and more accurate estimation. We demonstrate these advantages of our method over a baseline method through extensive evaluation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10580,Predictive Admission Control Algorithm for Advance Reservation in Equipment Grid.,"Experiments submitted to equipment grid have quality of service (QoS) requirements, and advance reservation is used to satisfy such requirements. Due to the dynamic behaviors and fluctuations of resources in equipment grid, some previously accepted advance reservations are unable to be fulfilled. In this paper, we present a predictive admission control algorithm to decide whether new advance reservation requests can be accepted according to their QoS requirements and prediction of future resource utilization. Historical data are used in this algorithm to predict future status of resources. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can reduce the number of accepted advance reservations that fail to be fulfilled and keep the resource utilization ratio at an acceptable level.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10581,Runtime Protocol Binding: Flexible Service Integration by Means of Flexible Service Interactions.,"Dynamic and flexible service composition and interactionare a must in Service Oriented Computing (SOC) scenarios. In this paper the authors present an extension to a previous work, the DENEB platform for the development and execution of Web processes, allowing Web processes to acquire and execute new interaction protocols at runtime. This makes DENEB a well adapted and flexible platform for service integration, useful to work in complex and evolving inter-organisational environments. The proposed solution is exemplified by means of the development of a real use case.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10582,Dynamic Support for BPEL Process Instance Adaptation.,"Rapidly changing market conditions and IT systems are forcing companies to adapt their business processes more dynamically than in the past. Most current commercial BPMS products lack the full capability to support changing processes. To address this challenge, we discuss three aspects of dynamic adaptation in a BPM system: model-level, instance-level, and runtime environment changes. We focus on analyzing the patterns of the instance-level navigation changes, including the preconditions, actions and consequences of each change. Based on this analysis, we propose a system design for the runtime environment to support dynamic instance-level changes. We have implemented a prototype of such a system with the motivating scenarios to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10583,Morpheus: Semantics-based Incremental Change Propagation in SOA-based Solutions.,"SOA-based solutions are typically modeled as business processes composed of loosely coupled services. Such an approach promises the flexibility to more easily customize the solution functionality in line with constantly changing customer requirements. The research issue that we address in this paper, therefore, is how to best accomplish this customization. Current approaches are typically manual and rather ad-hoc, involving repeated attempts to synchronize between (higher-level) design artifacts and (lowerlevel) source code to determine the configuration points. Alternatively, we propose a framework, Morpheus, which uses design artifacts to locate points of change in an SOA based solution via multi-level change propagation. First, we formally define the structure and semantics of the design artifacts, and the relationships among them. Second, we use these relationships to enumerate all possible changes in each design artifact; if two design artifacts share a relationship,then we also map a change in one design artifact to related changes in the other. Third, using these change relationships,we present an algorithm to traverse the design artifacts so as to propagate changes based on change requirements, ultimately resulting in the modifications needed to support the changed requirements. We illustrate our ideas on a simple yet realistic example in the insurance domain, and also present a prototype implementation.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10584,On the Specification of Payment Requirements for Collaborative Services.,"Payment arrangement is one of the vital issues in a B2B setting. For example, failing to accurately specify and communicate payment details such as the method of the payment, whether payment is refundable and negotiable, and what settlement model is used, can lead to serious disputes between the provider and requester of a service. However current development and solutions in service description, e.g., WSDL, do not cater for the specification and negotiation of payment related requirements for services. In this paper we present a comprehensive modeling approach for capturing and specifying payment requirements in the context of business collaboration. It will lay a foundation for service providers and requesters to explicitly define and adjust their business and technical requirements for payment in an adaptive and verifiable way. Furthermore, it provides support for terms of payment to be negotiated effectively to reach service provisioning agreements.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10585,To Establish Enterprise Service Model from Enterprise Business Model.,"One of the key activities that are needed to construct a quality service-oriented solution is the identification of its architectural elements with the right granularity. The selection of an appropriate method for identification of services from business models of an enterprise is thus quite crucial to the success of any service-oriented solution for that enterprise. Existing methods for service identification ignore required performance metrics and semantics integrity of business elements; more importantly, they focus on entity-based services while ignoring process based ones. This paper proposes a new process for identification and specification of enterprise software services and their architectural elements. A novel clustering technique, named Elementary business process and business Entity Affinity analysis Technique (EEAT), is introduced for identifying candidate architectural elements. This technique identifies each candidate service with the right granularity, while satisfying low coupling, high cohesion, and low reuse cost principles for reusable software services.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10586,Service-Oriented Architecture for VIEW: A Visual Scientific Workflow Management System.,"Scientific workflows have recently emerged as a new paradigm for scientists to formalize and structure complex and distributed scientific processes to enable and accelerate many scientific discoveries. In contrast to business workflows, which are typically controlflow oriented, scientific workflows tend to be dataflow oriented, introducing a new set of requirements for system development. These requirements demand a new architectural design for scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs). Although several SWFMSs have been developed that provide much experience for future research and development, a study from an architectural perspective is still missing. The main contributions of this paper are: i) based on a comprehensive survey of the literature and identification of key requirements for SWFMSs, we propose the first reference architecture for SWFMSs, ii) in compliance with the reference architecture, we further propose a service-oriented architecture for VIEW (a VIsual sciEntificWorkflow management system), iii) we implement VIEW to validate the feasibility of the proposed architectures, and iv) we present two case studies to showcase the applications of our VIEW system.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10587,Composing Web Services through Automatic Reformulation of Service Specifications.,"Typical approaches to service composition seek to realize a goal service specification, described using a labeled transition system (LTS) provided by a service developer, by constructing a structurally equivalent LTS using a set of available component services (also described using LTSs) that match the input and output requirements ofthe transitions. As such, existing composition approaches fail to realize the goal LTS whenever available component service LTSs cannot be used to ""mimic"" the structure of the goal LTS. This failure requires that the service developer formulates an alternate goal LTS and re-iterates the composition step. However, the process of manual reformulation of the goal LTS is both laborious and error prone. In this setting, we describe an efficient data structure and algorithms for analyzing data and control flow dependencies implicit in a user-supplied goal LTS specification to automatically generate alternate LTS specifications that capture the same overall functionality with respect to the data and control dependencies, and determine whether any of the alternatives can lead to a feasible composition. The result is a significant reduction in the need for the tedious manual intervention in reformulating LTS specifications of the goal service.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10588,A Reflective Framework to Improve the Adaptability of BPEL-based Web Service Composition.,"Web services composition is receiving significant amount of interest as an important strategy to allow enterprise collaboration. Current web services composition solutions are rather restricted and inflexible as they are based on pre-defined models of the process environment. These solutions have assumed that the information in the models and consequently the compositions remain static and unchanged throughout the life cycle of the web services composition. However, web services may run in a highly dynamic environment. Therefore, a mechanism is required to support web services composition in dynamic and flexible process environment. The reflective framework presented here aims to improve the adaptability of BPEL-based web service composition. A meta-model was defined to build the self-representation of the web services composition. The meta-model will be modified to adapt to the changing environment, and then, the reflection mechanism utilized in the framework will adjust the web services composition automatically. To ensure the correctness of dynamic adaptation, a set of constraints and a verification approach are proposed. A prototype adaptive service composition environment has been developing to implement our reflective framework and demonstrate its effectiveness on providing adaptive web services composition. In summary, it is stated that the reflective framework provides a suitable solution to the adaptive service composition and reliable control flow and data flow correctness.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10589,Proactive Runtime Service Discovery.,"In this paper we describe a framework that supports runtime service discovery in both pull and push modes. Our framework supports service discovery based on structural and behavioural models of services and applications, as well as quality and contextual constraints. In the approach, we use a proactive push mechanism in which services are identified in parallel to the execution of the system based on subscriptions of services and queries. A prototype tool has been implemented in order to illustrate and evaluate the framework.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10590,Pattern-based Policy Configuration for SOA Applications.,"Service Component Architecture (SCA) defines a component model that allows for a late binding with a concrete implementation. Similarly, the SCA policy framework defines a policy mechanism that uses intents, which are high-level declarations of desired nonfunctional features that are bound to concrete policies at a later time. The definitions of intents are simple, but the actual intent application is complex. Meeting policy requirements requires application of intents at many points in an assembly, and presumes domain knowledge about the semantics and constraints related to using a particular combination of intents. We propose pattern based policy configuration to resolve these difficulties. Our proposed configuration system has two features: policy intent patterns and pattern application rules. Domain knowledge is encoded as roles and role constraints in policy intent patterns. Pattern application rules can be used to define how patterns are applied automatically. This paper takes the original approach of thinking about policy application from a compositional perspective; this reduces the complexity of meeting nonfunctional requirements for SCA assemblies and provides a validation framework for applied intents.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (1),,,
10591,Formal Verification of Web Service Interaction Contracts.,"Abstract Recovery is the last resort when other components exhibit bugs. It is therefore of paramount importance that the correctness of the recovery protocols be formally verified. Recovery not only needs to cope with database failures but should handle and ideally mask message and process failures in clients and servers. Otherwise, when a reply message is lost the application must be able to determine ""manually"" whether the interaction is to be repeated. This paper develops a statechart specification of a recovery framework that generically guarantees exactly-once execution and applies model checking to prove its correctness.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10592,Generation of BPEL Customization Processes for SaaS Applications from Variability Descriptors.,"Software as a Service (SaaS) is a new delivery model for software. Software in a SaaS model is no longer run exclusively for one customer at a customer's premise but run at a service provider and accessed via the Internet. A provider of Software as a Service exploits economies of scale by hosting and providing the same application for several different customers. However, each individual customer has different requirements for the same basic application. In order to allow each customer to customize the process layer and related artifacts of a SaaS application to their specific needs the application needs to provide a set of variability points that can be modified by customers. In this paper we describe the notion of a variability descriptor that defines variability points for the process layer and related artifacts of process-based, service-oriented SaaS applications. Furthermore we describe how these variability descriptors can be transformed into a WS-BPEL process model that can then be used to guide a customer through the customization of the SaaS application.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10593,Data Model Design of Strategic Analysis Services for Specific Customer Oriented Industries.,"Facing fast changing and more diversified customers, specific customer oriented industries' executives should continuously make customer oriented strategic transformation decisions faster than competitors to obtain sustained growth. However, due to higher transformation cost per facility, increased frequency of transformation efforts, and greater complexity associated with rolling out quickly across large diverse facility networks, enterprises invest heavily yet often fail to deliver the required impacts. Executives in these industries are eager to have a quantitative method and tool to help them derive more scientific strategic transformation suggestions. In this paper, we describe a general analytics and optimization solution designed to provide strategic analysis services for those specific industries to adapt to the fast changing needs. The data model design is elaborated for efficient communication and quick solution development, and an implementation case study on intelligent facility network analytics and optimization services design in retailing industry is finally presented to illustrate how the proposed data model improves the flexibility of solutions across industries.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

10595,Modeling Service Quality for Dynamic QoS Publishing.,"As web services are widely adopted, the nonfunctional requirements (i.e. QoS constraints) have become a significant factor in implementing trustworthy and predictable service applications. In this paper, we analyze the QoS publishing necessity, and categorize QoS parameters to refine their characteristics. Then we propose a conceptual publishing model, which is adaptive for the distributed and decentralized service-oriented computing environment. We further introduce the perception service quality measurement models, and extend P-E model for web services. The extended model takes both dynamic QoS parameters and customer expectations into consideration. A compensation mechanism is also incorporated into the model for trade-off when nonfunctional requirements cannot be fully satisfied.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10596,Policy-Based Automation to Improve Solution Engineering in IT Services.,"IT out sourcing service providers are increasingly being challenged to reduce costs while improving the quality of service implementation and delivery. A key contributor to those goals can be an improved methodology for services solution engineering - which involves analysis of the client's requirements and environment, mapping the information to the capabilities of the service provider, documenting the design and implementation of each service, and defining transformations of the customer's environment to the target IT infrastructure defined by the overall design that facilitates more efficient service delivery. One such improved methodology leverages reuse, in the form of a taxonomy of standardized service offerings and a repository of standardized service designs they can be mapped to. In this paper, we describe a prototype system that provides automation for such a methodology by encoding design policies that are used to assist the services solution architect gather relevant information from the customer and cross check design decisions. The approach demonstrates how the notion of computer-aided design can be applied to the world of IT services and introduced in an incremental manner. This paper presents the system architecture, discusses the sources and models of knowledge, and illustrates how this knowledge can be used with specific examples from the services field.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10597,Service-Oriented Mobile Applications for Ad-Hoc networks.,"Mobile phones are becoming a new popular platform for business applications. The number of mobile business users increases and so does the need for efficient mobile data exchange and collaboration. However, a traditional business application design approach is not suitable for mobile devices because of the limited memory and connection bandwidth. This paper presents a lightweight mobile SOA-based approach to interaction between business applications running on J2ME enabled devices such as cell phones. The paper includes position statement based on our experience and describes a prototype implementation of the architecture. The important features of our design are: using the knowledge of business processes workflow and XML compression to minimize data transferred; pro-active data push and allowing applications to fully function in a disconnected mode. The above approach results in a lightweight framework which can be used in order to develop a wide spectrum of business-oriented applications.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10598,Towards a General Framework for Web Service Composition.,"Service-oriented computing (SOC) has emerged as the eminent market environment for sharing and reusing service-centric capabilities. The underpinning for an organization's use of SOC techniques is the ability to discover and compose Web services. In this paper we present a generalized semantics-based technique for automatic service composition that combines the rigor of process-oriented composition with the descriptiveness of semantics. Our generalized approach extends the common practice of linearly linked services by introducing the use of a conditional directed acyclic graph (DAG) where complex interactions, containing control flow, information flow and pre/post conditions, are effectively represented.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10599,A Fault Tolerance Approach for Enterprise Applications.,"Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) have emerged as a preferred solution to tackle the complexity of large-scale, complex, distributed, and heterogeneous systems. Key to successful operation of these systems is their reliability and availability. In this paper, we propose an approach to creating fault tolerant SOA implementations based on an architectural pattern called Rich Services. Our approach is model-driven, focuses on interaction specifications as the means for defining services and managing their failures, and is technology independent. We leverage an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) framework to implement a system based on the fault tolerant Rich Service pattern. We evaluate our approach by measuring availability and reliability of an experimental system in the e-business domain.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10600,A Service-Oriented Approach to Storage Backup.,"Various organizations face an explosive growth of data that must be protected and backed up. This challenge is made more difficult by the movement from stand-alone server backup to backup over the local area network (LAN) and by the need to automatically manage multiple backup servers efficiently for concurrent backup jobs. In this paper, we present a novel software approach to backup service, where application servers provide their unused resources to participate in a virtual backup environment. We implement a prototype with the following desirable features: single-instance storage to save storage and communication costs, data replication to enhance data availability, data redirection to avoid job resubmission, and intelligent scheduling to achieve workload balance. The experimental study shows that our approach is promising.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10601,Three Factors to Sustainable Service System Excellence: A Case Study of Service Systems.,"Prior service science work defines a service system as dynamic configuration of people, technology, organizations, and shared information from both service providers and clients that co-creates value [1]. Although such an abstraction is important, it does not directly address core issues we face in today's service industry, such as sustainable service excellence. This paper expands such prior service science work by analyzing how service systems evolve over time and what factors are critical to sustain service excellence. The paper identified and analyzed three factors attributing to the service system health throughout its lifecycle phases: the instilling of the value co-creation concept in the service system, the balancing of innovation and commoditization dynamics, and the configuration of core resources in the service system, i.e., people, technology, organization, and shared information. The analysis is derived from many real-world case studies in the information analytics service area. Key recommendations and lessons learned are presented as well.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10602,A Scenario-View Based Approach to Analyze External Behavior of Web Services for Supporting Mediated Service Interactions.,"Web service interactions have triggered the initiative to identify and solve mismatches from a behavioral aspect. Current approaches are limited since they mainly focus on control-flow but largely ignore data-flow. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically generate scenarios and views for describing external behavior of Web services, i.e. the public process, considering both control-flow and data-flow. We define a scenario as a set of complete execution paths for a public process. Data dependencies are presented as a dependency graph, which is optimized into a minimal dependency graph. Then, a view is generated to describe a scenario for analysis purposes, and external behavior of a Web service is described as a finite set of views. Our approach is very useful for service modelers and users to better understand the external behavior of Web services, to identify and solve mismatches from a behavioral aspect, and thus to facilitate Web service interactions.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10603,Mining Top Issues from Contact Center Logs for Self Help Portals.,"Self help portals are increasingly popular means for enabling users to find information, resolve problems, and process transactions directly without calling contact centers. Such portals can result in faster problem resolution for users and cost savings for the contact center. However, the effectiveness of self help portals is often limited by the topicality, recency, and relevance of the knowledge (documents, etc.) that users are provided access to. In this paper, we present a system and an architecture for automatically mining the top issues â€“ questions people are calling contact centers for â€“ and presenting corresponding solution documents to users through self help portals. Running the top issues mining regularly (e.g. hourly, daily, etc.) ensures dynamically updated and relevant content on the portals and can greatly reduce costs at contact centers by avoiding calls. Furthermore, top issues mining can highlight the knowledge gap or the issues for which no solution documents currently exist. We describe our end to end system, present algorithms for mining, and discuss the knowledge gap that can prevent self enabling portals from realizing its potential benefits.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10604,Towards Agile Service-oriented Business Systems: A Directive-oriented Pattern Analysis Approach.,"Volatile requirements should be managed such that changes can be introduced into the system in a quick and structured way. This paper presents Directive-oriented Pattern Analysis (DoPA), a requirements engineering approach that handles volatile requirements by managing the coupling between business intentions and service integration. The key insight is to utilise services as commodities via service choreography patterns. DoPA captures differentiating enterprise intentions as Directives, while using patterns to handle common business needs. This enables the notion of declarative configuration of services to achieve business agility.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

We describe the Voice of Customer (VoC) and Customer Satisfaction (C-Sat) analysis settings and outline several unique research challenges brought about by this confluence of text mining and industrial services research. We describe our system for integrated \tc{}, business intelligence and interactive text labeling for C-Sat analysis. We recount invaluable lessons learned as computer science researchers in services research engagements. The system has been deployed in multiple accounts in contact centers and can be extended to any industrial CRM service practice to analyze unstructured text data.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10607,A Customer-Centric Privacy Protection Framework for Mobile Service-Oriented Architectures.,"Mobile companions such as smart phones and PDAs carry a lot of sensitive data about their owners. With new services aimed at providing more targeted information retrieval through increased interactions with these devices, privacy concerns of individuals must be addressed. Existing mobile service computing solutions give users little control over the release of this information. In this paper, we present a privacy-aware information brokerage framework called MUPPET that incorporates three novel techniques to give users control over the release of their data. First, it introduces Operation-focused Access Control, a purpose-based access control model that supports flexible and fine-grain policies using typed operation labels. Second, MUPPET includes a Purpose Detector that has a number of techniques to detect the active purpose in a pervasive environment. Third, our system allows Reward-Driven Information Exchange, a protocol for explicit communication and negotiation of justifications and rewards supporting tunable privacy policies based on ongoing evaluation of the information exchange. To validate our design, the MUPPET prototype has been integrated with a personalized coupon offering application for two different service providers in an experimental retail kiosk setting.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

In the tactical military context its ultimate goals are greater situational awareness and enhanced operational capability through the efficient sharing of information. Component systems, such as networks and data sources, can provide many of the necessary services to achieve these goals. A structured approach, however, is needed to realize this within command and control systems. This paper describes a hierarchical approach to information integration, called integration layers, and the conceptual foundations for such a structure, using chemical and biological warfare information-system services as examples.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10610,Built-to-Order Service Engineering for Enterprise IT Discovery.,"Enterprise IT environments are complex: business applications rely on distributed middleware running on diverse hardware with components depending on each other in many unexpected ways. Discovery of applications' dependency on IT is a critical step in managing application and IT infrastructure together. Many tools and practices have emerged to discover and report IT assets and applications' dependency on the IT assets. However, our experience in the field shows that there are significant challenges in effectively deploying the tools. There is a critical need to research and develop flexible processes, methods, and practices, and architecture-level support for them in the tools to enable successful discovery using a ""built-to-order"" approach. In this paper we discuss our experiences with an advanced application-data relationship discovery tools in large scale enterprise environments and based on these experiences we identify three main challenges of effective discovery. They are: deployment process and related security issues; unavailability of software and administration-related information; and tool integration. To address these challenges, here we demonstrate a holistic approach that includes flexible processes, methods, and practices in the tools for achieving the necessary built-to order capability.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10611,Managing Security and Privacy Integration across Enterprise Business Process and Infrastructure.,"Managing information security and privacy assurance are fiduciary responsibilities of all government and commercial organizations, but standing up a comprehensive fully-assured environment from the onset may be technically or financially impossible. Many organizations inadequately address this challenge from a 'bottom-up' or piece-meal perspective, certifying and accrediting individual systems or focusing on perimeter systems and portals. A systematic enterprise-wide risk-management approach to information security and privacy is both practical and economically feasible, but must holistically integrate such requirements into both business process management and the technical infrastructure to be effective. The authors' development of the Roadmap for Information Security across the Enterprise (RISE) methodology establishes a systematic approach to security and privacy management by leveraging enterprise architecture approaches, and ensures implementation control by integrating the processes and responsibility with enterprise-level portfolio management. RISE defines an iterative threat assessment and response cycle and integrates it with capital planning and investment control (CPIC) for both operational and infrastructure initiatives. This paper describes how RISE ensures risk-informed continuous process improvement and capital planning by maintaining an architecturally founded knowledge base supporting strategic planning and investment review.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

10613,Towards a Service Management System in Virtualized Infrastructures.,"Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is becoming the prevalent architectural style for the creation of agile and flexible enterprise IT infrastructures. Services, as the key elements of Service-oriented Computing (SOC), can be composed in very efficient way to support flexible business processes and to adapt application systems quickly to new business requirements. Virtualization technologies offer cost-effective and rapid resource scalability as well as greater flexibility in providing hardware resources to service demands. However, also service-oriented applications need to be tested, monitored and maintained; thus the management aspect of Service-oriented infrastructures is often neglected. We propose a Service Management System that enhances the management of infrastructures for SOC and describes a first step towards the self-management of services in infrastructures with virtualized hardware resources. This paper provides a core set of components and required management functions that must be considered in providing a Service Management System for SOC.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10614,An Interdisciplinary Methodology for Building Service-oriented Systems on the Web.,"Services can be characterized as activities in which providers and customers co-create value. The need for a tight collaboration between providers and customers is thus an important distinguishing aspect of services compared to products. Traditional software engineering methodologies provide limited support for collaborative processes at runtime and are therefore not directly applicable to service engineering. In particular, the design of coordination mechanisms between service provider and customers as well as the design of a common vocabulary in an interorganizational setting is not adequately addressed. To face these shortcomings, we present an interdisciplinary approach integrating just recently proposed Web service engineering methodologies with market and ontology engineering to one coherent service engineering methodology.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10615,Rule-based XML Mediation for Data Validation and Privacy Anonymization.,"XML mediation for data validation and privacy anonymization of very large complicated XML messages defined in some industry-specific specifications such as HL7 is becoming increasingly important in SOA because a lot of applications depend on various kinds of hard-coded data validation and privacy anonymization functions, which makes it difficult to keep consistency of the functions among the applications in SOA when the schema of the XML messages in the specifications is updated. This paper proposes a uniform rule-based approach to realize the functions as an XML mediation separated from the applications, which makes it easy to maintain consistency of the functions even when they are updated in accord with the changes to the specifications. Therefore, application developers can readily utilize the mediation with many applications in SOA without additional modification to the applications. Our approach allows the developers to define a set of rules that consist of two components: 1) constraint conditions in a conceptual data notation in the XML message, and 2) actions performed only when the conditions are satisfied. In order to make the rules independent from both the implementation-specific data representation and the industry-specific knowledge, we automatically transform the rules into the implementation-specific data representation using two more factors; one is the data mappings from the data notation in the rules to the concrete data representation in the implementation, and the other is the implied data relationships hidden in the rules. It is very important to take into consideration a general way to import the implied knowledge because it often depends on the industry-specific data structure and it is usually given outside of the mediation system.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10616,WSLA+: Web Service Level Agreement Language for Collaborations.,"The Web Service Level Agreement (WSLA) is a Web Service specification language developed to provide a SLA template to capture all the information negotiated and agreed upon by a service provider and service consumer. Though this specification is suitable for many Business-to-Business collaborations involving two parties, it does not fulfil the requirement of a new business model involving multiple parties, where a party provides multiple services to other parties and consumes services provided by other parties. To address this requirement, this paper proposes an extension to the WSLA language to capture multi-party collaborations, called WSLA+.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10617,A Framework for QoS Driven Selection of Services.,"In a service-oriented system (SoS), service requests define tasks to execute and quality of service (QoS) criteria to optimize. A service request is submitted to the service selector in the SoS, which allocates tasks to the service that can 'best' satisfy the given QoS criteria. When the selector cannot optimize simultaneously the given QoS criteria, users need to specify priorities and preferences over the said criteria. Accounting for users' QoS priorities and preferences is therefore necessary during service selection.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10618,Robust Web Service Discovery in Large Networks.,"Web service discovery is a fundamental part in web service architectures. UDDI is a web service directory that was primarily intended to discover new web services in the Internet for business-to-business interaction. Another application domain of web service discovery is local area networking, where a dynamic web service discovery at runtime is required. Web Services Dynamic Discovery (WS-Discovery) is a specification that deals with local ad-hoc networks. A predefined IP multicast group is used for dynamic discovery within a subnet. In this paper we present an enhancement of WS-Discovery that allows for service lookups across subnet boundaries. We propose a dedicated proxy server, that implements cross-subnet discovery while preserving the multicast discovery within each subnet for compatibility and robustness. Thus, this technology becomes usable in enterprise-level networks.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Migration of checkpoints presumes a high grade of compatibility between source and target resource. Hence, even in large Grid systems only a small number of resources are eligible migration targets. This short paper describes the concept of virtual execution environments and how they increase the number of potential migration targets. It will also outline an implementation within OpenCCS.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

It aims to provide an open-source distributed environment to support the spontaneous evolution and composition of services forSMEs. A two-tier architecture model as a simplified version of the system is presented, consisting of a business network layer and a P2P communication layer that interact with each other and evolve over time. The benefit of the model-driven approach is to allow us running discrete event simulations on it to study, e.g how the topology of the SME network affects the topology of the P2Pcommunication network.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Here, we propose a service-based architecture for data mining applications, including configuration service, service engine, monitor service, analysis service, visualization service, computing service and data &mp; algorithm provision service. The first 5 services focus on 5 specific aspects of data mining requirements. A demo system has also been developed to validate the feasibility of our architecture.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

Data is passed via shared variables and there is no notion of explicit data links. However, explicit data links are an important means to reason about business process models. We present an algorithm to derive explicit data links in WS-BPEL processes. By considering dead path elimination as defined in WS-BPEL, we reduce the number of derived data links when compared to existing approaches that ignore dead path elimination.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10623,WIPdroid Â– A Two-way Web Services and Real-time Communication Enabled Mobile Computing Platform for Distributed Services Computing.,"We present a mobile distributed computing platform, WIPdroid, for distributed services computing in mobile environment with real-time communication capabilities. It is based on WIP, Web Services Session Initiation Protocol, for real-time service-oriented communication over IP. It integrates the emerging mobile endpoint platform, Android, from Google's initiative of Open Handset Alliance (OHA). The WIP component of WIPdroid supports web services based communication over IP. But most importantly, it transforms WIPdroid into a mobile SOA web services endpoint. Applications developed on WIPdroid can be exposed and enabled by two-way web services. This makes WIPdroid well suited for distributed computing and SOA based applications, such as communication enabled business process (CEBP) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). It also leads to a new type of dual-mode phone, with one communication mode from the binding with the physical mobile environment, e.g. GSM, CDMA, 3G, etc., and one fully web services enabled, service-oriented communication over IP mode from WIP. A prototype WIPdroid mobile computing platform is developed and tested. In order to support advance web services capabilities on mobile endpoints, we developed an endpoint-edition of two-way web services application proxy (2SAP) which has a small memory footprint (2~3 MB) and can be hosted on a mobile endpoint/handset, e.g. smart phone and PDA.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10624,Component-Based Composition of Wide-Area Workflows.,"The evolution of workflow models has been characterized by profound flux ever since the formative days of flow charts. Despite, or because of, a proliferation of workflow-oriented standards, none can honestly claim to be ubiquitous. In a widely distributed grid, gaps will inevitably exist in the model of workflows deployed therein. Thus, there is a need to present a consistent view of disparate processes to high-level roles such as analysts. To that end, we propose virtualizing the workflow layer to reconcile such gaps, both in the modeling and the execution sense. Given a wide area network of workflow providers, we overlay it with one based on WS-BPEL, our reference model. For every provider, we build virtualization-enabling silos, realized as components driven by a SCA container. Further, we describe design patterns to facilitate bindings to other models at various levels. Finally, we take reality checks by identifying those patterns in such standards as BPMN, XPDL, WWF and ebBP.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

The Semantically-Enhanced Resource Allocator (SERA) is a framework designed to obtain an efficient autonomous service provider management while fulfilling customers' requests. While the efficient dynamic resource management is obtained by means of virtualization and agents, in this paper, we focus on how semantics can help on the task scheduling and resource allocation. In SERA, tasks and resources are semantically described following a resource ontology and resource assignments are inferred by means of a set of rules that define the scheduling policies taking into account the SP business goals.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10626,From Feature Models to Business Processes.,"The variability level of average-size Business Information Systems (BIS) is highly enough for making the design of this kind of systems a complex task. There is an approach called Process Family Engineering (PFE) that tries to ease the design of BIS using ideas from the Software Product Lines (SPL) field. Roughly speaking, they propose to, first, study the variability of the system without entering into details by means of building a variability model (called feature model), that is used later for building the business process. However, in PFE the process of deriving the business process from the feature model is performed manually. Authors use feature models with a different meaning that is commonly accepted in SPL. In this paper, we provide a rigorous description for the new meaning of feature models, and a mapping relationship that defines how to use the information in the FM for obtaining the basic structure of the business process. In addition, as a proof of concepts, we have implemented an MDD transformation that provides the expected results.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

The e-Engineering framework aims to integrate engineering services and mediate between them for the processing of the engineering process. The collaboration within the framework is very similar to a business process, in terms of web service composition. However, the existing web service composition system shows some limitations when dealing with engineering services. This paper presents a QoS-based web service orchestration system for the e-Engineering framework by analyzing the characteristics of engineering services which usually perform numerical analysis. The characteristics of the services are expressed in the form of constraint and selection specification.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

In this paper, we propose a novel method of rapidly designing presentation module for an SOA-based solution using fine-grained configurable architectural building blocks (ABBs). An ABB-based presentation pattern derived from industry best practices is presented, associated with a tailored ABB configuration framework. We also introduce a formal way of modeling ABBs and their interactions. Real-life experiences of applying our ABB-based model are condensed into sixteen architectural decision points, which are further applied into a variety of SOA solution projects. Experiences accumulated over these decision points are summarized into a set of guidelines to help engineers select and configure ABBs specific to services scenarios and requirements.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

10634,SOAR: SOcially Aware Routing for Request Matching in Enterprise Environments.,"A social networking model has been shown to be effective in routing queries in referral systems and cellular networks, and also in the production of frequently asked questions (FAQ) repository. In this paper, we extend its applicability to dispatch applications as part of resolving problem and change requests in an IT outsourcing environment. In such an environment, requests often get re-routed and traverse multiple work-groups before being resolved. However, the trail left behind resembles a thread of social interactions among subject matter experts (SMEs) in solving requests. We use such interactions to track the performance of each SME in resolving problems of different domains. In this work, we propose the SOcially Aware Routing (SOAR) system that leverages such social interactions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of routing future requests. The system can incorporate multiple routing policies and provides load-balancing while maintaining a high degree of routing accuracy. Based on preliminary evaluation, our scheme is found to attain an accuracy of 91% in the steady state.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,
10635,A Fuzzy-set based Semantic Similarity Matching Algorithm for Web Service.,"A critical step in the process of reusing existing WSDL-specified services for building web-based applications is the discovery of potentially relevant services. However, the category-based service discovery, such as UDDI, is clearly insufficient. Semantic Web Services, augmenting Web service descriptions using Semantic Web technology, were introduced to facilitate the publication, discovery, and execution of Web services at the semantic level. Semantic matchmaker enhances the capability of UDDI service registries in the Semantic Web Services architecture by applying some matching algorithms between advertisements and requests described in OWL-S to recognize various degrees of matching for Web services. Based on Semantic Web Service framework, semantic matchmaker, specification matching and probabilistic matching approach, this paper proposes a fuzzy-set based semantic similarity matching algorithm for Web Service to support a more automated and veracity service discovery process in the Semantic Web Service Framework.",2008,,,,,IEEE SCC (2),,,

We show that virtual learning services have rich opportunities of service innovation. Virtual services have additional dimensions beyond traditional Web services which have significant influence on both its research and industry applications.

This is inpart triggered by the intense competition as well as theretailers' drive to reach the customers through allpossible channels. As the number of channels for aretailer increases, managing the dynamics of customerbehavior in the multi-channel environment becomescomplex. Customers have an option of interacting withretailers across a number of channels. Acquiring andretaining customers requires that relationshipmanagement applications should be able toaccommodate the various channels.

For a directory with a large numbers of entries, the result set of a query may be large, too. In this case it is important to order the results according to heuristics and to retrieve them incrementally. Our contribution is an integrated directory system specially adapted to large-scale service discovery and composition. We introduce DirQL, a flexible query language for the matching and ranking of service descriptions. As results are incrementally retrieved, our system is able to lazily compute the result set based on: 1) the organization of the directory as a special balanced search tree that has an extra ""intersection"" discriminator, 2) a scheme for transforming the original query into one taking into account the tree structure of the directory, and 3) the organization of partial results in a heap structure sorted according to the transformed query. We also report on experimental results regarding the usage of the directory by a composition engine solving randomly generated problems.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

However,this does not work when the available services onlycover a part of the range of the input type. We present an algorithmthat also allows partial matches and composesthem using switches that decide on the required serviceat runtime based on the actual data type. We report experimentson randomly generated composition problemsthat show that using partial matches can decrease the failurerate of the integration algorithm using only completematches by up to 7 times with no increase in the numberof directory accesses required.

This leads to consider the viability ofapplying configuration techniques to this problem. Our main contribution is to prove the feasibility of such an approach, with some advantagesand drawbacks compared to logical based techniques.

The proposed theoretical framework is used to design, derive and verify WS interface for full duplex two-way WS interaction. An algorithm of interface verification is described that allows effective WS interface design and verification to support asynchronous two-way WS operation and event notification. The interface verification algorithm in our approach utilizes verificationby derivation and verification by content to validate theclient interface in two-way WS interaction.

370514,Modeling Quantifying and Testing Complex Aggregate Service Chains.,"Service chaining, the act of stringing a sequence of services togetherto form a new service, is a key element of web services. However, forweb services to reach its full potential the issue of testing service- chaining at the network level must be resolved. How can one map themicro-level service-service interactions to the macro-level systemperformance? For instance, as service chains become longer and morecomplex, how do they affect end-user quality of service? Focusing onaggregate service chains.situations in which the user invokes a servicethat carries out the chain, without the user being aware of the individualservices.we tackle these questions using a Java simulation tool to modelservice chaining, visualize network traffic and quantify service chaincomplexity. We demonstrate that one can orchestrate very complexservice chains in a simple distributed manner and quantify how servicechain complexity affects end-user quality of service and network loading.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this work, we have extendedthe functionality of the Web services broker to includeconstraint specification and processing, which enablesthe broker to find a good match between a serviceprovider's capabilities and a service requestor'srequirements.

370521,Protocol-Based Business Process Modeling and Enactment.,"Business processes are conventionally modeled as monolithicflows that capture the desired business logic. However,developing process flows is challenging. Because aflow specifies what its participants should do, it restrictsthe autonomy of its participants, thus limiting their abilityto exploit opportunities or accommodate exceptions accordingto their business preferences.We take a dual perspective wherein business processesare modeled as compositions of (instantiated) business protocols.Each business protocol specifies interactions amongits partners; each protocol serves a unique business purpose,e.g., processing a payment or shipping an item. Thus,modularizing a monolithic business process via businessprotocols allows clear separation of concerns for modelingand enacting the process.We develop an approach in which protocols are compiledinto local skeletal flows for each participant that can befleshed out with local business logic as needed. Such flowsare naturally distributed but can be enacted using commercialbusiness flow engines. Thus, our protocol-based approachcombines the benefit of improved modeling with simplifiedimplementations.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Onetechnique, that has received some attention, for automaticallycomposing workflows is AI-based classical planning.However, classical planning suffers from the paradox of firstassuming deterministic behavior of Web services, then requiringthe additional overhead of execution monitoringto recover from unexpected behavior of services. To addressthese concerns, we propose using Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs), to model workflow composition. Ourmethod models both, the inherent stochastic nature of Webservices, and the dynamic nature of the environment. The resultingworkflows are robust to non-deterministic behaviorsof Web services and adaptive to a changing environment.Using an example scenario, we demonstrate our methodand provide empirical results in its support.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

And yet, the semantics of service or componentcomposition have remained elusive. The contribution of this paperbuilds on the notions introduced by grammar-oriented objectdesign (GOOD) using the notion of manners to specify thesemantics of services and drive their automated compositionthrough dynamically re-configure architectures enabled throughGOOD. This leads to the use of manners for explicit servicesemantics representation in a re-configurable architectural style.We describe the base requirements for automated component andservices composition and show how automated assembly ofcomponents and services can be accomplished through adynamically reconfigurable (DyRec) architectural style.In addition, we show how this vision of dynamic reconfigurationis naturally supported by the Web services framework, because itderives from some of the core requirements of the ServiceOriented Architectures (SOA) style embodied by Web services.Further, we discuss how such a DyRec architectural style can beimplemented using grammar-oriented object design (GOOD) anddescribe a project that led to a tool called the Business Compiler,to accomplish dynamic composition and collaboration.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

370533,Orchestrating Composite Web Services under Data Flow Constraints.,"A composite service is typically specified using a language such asBPEL4WS and orchestrated by a single coordinator node in acentralized manner. The coordinator receives the client request,makes the required data transformations and invokes the componentweb services as per the specification. However, in certain scenariosbusinesses might want to impose restrictions on access to the datathey provide or the source from which they can accept data. Centralized orchestration can lead to violation of these data flow constraints as the central coordinator has access to the input and output dataof all the component web services. In many cases existing methodsof data encryption and authentication are not sufficient to handle suchconstraints. These data flow constraints, thus, present obstacles forcomposite web service orchestration. In this paper we propose a solution for orchestrating composite webservices under data flow constraints. The solution is based on decentralizedorchestration, in which a composite web service is broken into a setof partitions, one partition per component web service. To overcomedata flow constraints, each partition is executed within the same domain as the corresponding component web service and hence, hasthe same access rights. However, there are, in general, many ways todecentralize a composite web service. We apply a rule based filtering mechanism to choose a set of partitionsthat does not violate the specified data flow constraints.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

Easy configurability and interplay of web entities implies evolution of a fewcommon sense, yet powerful set of core primitives for effective coordination,akin in simplicity and strength to the HTTP protocol. Current webservices technology lacks Infrastructure support, theoretical soundfundamental framework for web services coordination and composition,and easy use tools for web application development. Our Web Coordination Bond system gears towards finding solutions to afore- mentioned research challenges. We have proposed web coordinationbonds as a potential candidate for a set of core artifacts for web service coordination/choreography [2]. Section 2 illustrates the ideasof web coordination bonds. Section 3 introduces the concept of WebProcess Architecture, which is a simple but powerful enhancement tothe web services infrastructure that makes web services stateful,coordination and transaction aware capable enteritis.

We analyze existinglanguages such as BPEL4WS and OWL-S before addressingtheir deficiencies in our proposal. Our approach allowsa client to invoke a service based solely on a shared ontology,i.e. without prior knowledge on the API, providing animportant building block towards a global, flexible informationinfrastructure. Another main point is that WSDFcan be applied to clients and services written in a conventionalobject oriented programming language. This isachieved by lifting datastructures to an ontology level inwhich rich logical statements about services can be formalized.We also present a detailed system architecturethat covers planning, invocation, and the automatic processingof the service results, which is accomplishedusing the observer design pattern and by asserting the resultin the respective model. Furthermore, the requiredannotations can be specified conveniently by placing commentsin the source code.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370541,Towards Intelligent Services: A Case Study in Chemical Emergency Response.,"In a short period the Web has become an important part of our lives.However, the full potential of the web is still not realized. Two recentdevelopments--web services and the semantic web--are steps in thedirection of utilizing the full potential of the Web. Web services allow applications to utilize the web for automatically extracting(and updating) information while the semantic web enterprise promisesto provide the infrastructure that allows intelligent web services to berapidly created and deployed. However, with this comes the taskof transforming the traditional web-based systems to web-servicesover the semantic web. In this paper, we demonstrate how an existingsuccessful web-based system for providing help to first responders ofchemically hazardous emergencies (called E-plan) can be converted into a web-services based model using the semantic web and intelligentreasoning technologies.

Unlike their ""static"" counterparts, mobile devices are typically connected via a wirelessnetwork forcing them to deal with constrained bandwidth and the sudden loss of connectivity. This paper focuses on the use of caching SOAP request-responsepairs in order to compensate for fluctuating bandwidth and loss ofconnectivity. We introduce the concept of embedded SOAP caching, highlighting the need for meta-data as a means to support it. A novelSOAP cache (CRISP) that can be embedded into the application orused as an independent proxy-cache is presented and evaluated under various loads and settings. The evaluation of CRISP showsthat caching of SOAP traffic is not only an effective means to compensatefor loss of connectivity but also enables reducing network loads which is particularly interesting when dealing with bandwidth constraintwireless connections.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370545,Improving Web Service QoS for Wireless Pervasive Devices.,"The web services enable interaction among remote and diverseapplications running on disparate platforms. While the service providersoffer generic service response to meet the requirements of diverse client applications, it is the responsibility of the application to extractrelevant data from the response. This causes performance overheadsfor power and network bandwidth limited pervasive devices due tonetworking and parsing excess data. It is thus important for servicesand pervasive applications to interact in a way that optimally utilizesthe resources of the pervasive device. In this paper we describe anefficient interaction methodology between web services and pervasive applications that optimizes the service quality for the device. We extendthe quality of service definition beyond service response time to includepower and airtime utilization and allow pervasive applications to be awareabout it to dynamically adapt to the services and the available resourcesof the device in realtime.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370546,A Peer-to-Peer Framework for Web Service Discovery with Ranking.,"Current Web service discovery methods are based oncentralized approaches where Web services are identifiedbased on service functionality. Examples of service functionalityinclude car rental, hotel booking and book selling.Since higher level Web services are increasingly composedin terms of lower level Web services, it is importantthat service discovery not only be based on service functionalitybut also be based on process behavior, i.e., how aservice functionality is served. Furthermore, centralized approachesto service discovery suffer from problems such ashigh operational and maintenance cost, single point of failure,and scalability. Another issue that has not been consideredin current Web service discovery paradigms is the issueof trust and quality of service of the service provider.We, therefore, propose a structured peer-to-peer frameworkfor Web service discovery in which Web services are locatedbased on both service functionality and process behavior. Inaddition, we integrate a scalable reputation model in thisdistributed peer-to-peer framework to rank Web servicesbased on both trust and service quality.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Service-oriented architectures (SOA) permit us to developnew generations of integrated business applications from reusablecomponents and along structures that represent mundane aswell as sophisticated business processes. However, experiencesin business process modeling show that developing Web servicesand the corresponding orchestration layer is quite challenging.

These architectures primarily considered static business contracts between the service providerand its (web-service enabled) business partners. This approach makes these architectures inflexible to variations in business requirement, partners' performance and customer requirements. Our architecture provides a flexible means for service providers tooptimize business performance.

The smart card technology presents an attractivesolution for providing strong security and access control mechanismsthat are tightly bound and associated to the individual carrying andowning the card. Despite its potential, smart card services have notbeen integrated into the networked environment in the way otherportable computing devices, such as notebooks, PDA, mobile phones,and so on, have been. This has motivated our design for a distributedcomputing platform for smart card services to operate over a service- oriented architecture (SOA) based on evolving Web Servicestechnology. In particular, the paper presents the design of theWSCard (in short for Web Services Card) architecture and itsimplementation based on the application of web services wrappingtechnology. Importantly, the design allows us to exploit Web Services flexibility to provide a heterogeneous and promote rapidintegration of smart card services as first class citizens of web services.With WSCard, existing service-oriented applications can seamlessly interoperate with smart card services by treating the card services asnative web services, while employing established web services standards-- SOAP, WSDL and UDDI.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370555,Performance Impact of Web Service Migration in Embedded Environments.,"The benefits provided by Web Service protocols are well recognized.Deployments to date, however, have concentrated on new applications,and existing Web-based applications. A host of legacy applications andprotocols continue to exist in their native forms, outdated, yet entrenched due to large installed bases. This paper details our observations inintegrating a Web Service infrastructure into the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP). SNMP has been in use for over adecade and a half, predominantly in network equipment embeddedsystems. Our Web Servicebased approach allows us to enhance ourexisting application with XML/SOAP interoperability, SSL/TLS security, and the potential to migrate both application and protocol layers toencompass future extensions and Web browser accessibility. The difficultywith SNMP, and many other legacy networking protocols, is that muchof the extensive installed base is hosted on limited capability, legacyhardware. While the benefits of our scheme are quite tangible, theperformance impact of adding these features is not well known. Weexamine two approaches, an integrated solution using a light-weightHTTP/SOAP stack, as well as a standard Java Web serverimplementation. Our tests reveal unanticipated performance resultsthrough both the integrated and proxy methods.

These challenges call for vastimprovements in the Web services containers and the mediation infrastructure. To address these requirements, we propose WebServices Message Bus (wsBus), a lightweight service-orientedmiddleware for reliable and fault tolerant Web services interactions.This paper first discusses wsBus architecture and features and then it reports some experimental results to illustrate theeffectiveness of wsBus in adding reliable and uninterrupted servicesto a supply chain management system.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

As the number of available Webservices grows, the representation of the context inwhich they are used becomes more and more an issuefor both service providers and service consumers.While providers concentrate more on the technicallevels of activation and communication within aservice network, the users, i.e. the service consumers,want to form ad-hoc collaborations between Webservices. To shield users of Web services from thetechnical details of finding and combining them, asemantic level has to be found that suits their specificneeds and expertise. Through a semantic layer, WS-Talktries to create a level of abstraction that enablesviews on services expressed in natural language. Toreduce the complexity of natural language, domain-specificlanguages are defined and their semantics aremapped onto Web services and their attributes. Thedomain of economics is currently used for testingarchitecture and usage aspects of the WS-Talkinterface layer.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

We extend the synchronizability analysis toHSMs to efficiently identify composite web services whose globalinteractions can be analyzed with respect to unbounded queues usingfinite state model checkers. We also discuss automated translation ofbehavioral interfaces specified as HSMs to BPEL specifications to bepublished and used by other services.,2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370562,A Trust-based Context-Aware Access Control Model for Web-Services.,"A key challenge in Web services security is the design of effective access control schemes that can adequately meet the unique security challenges posed by the Web services paradigm. Despite the recent advances in Web based access control approaches applicable to Web services, there remain issues that impede the development of effective access control models for Web services environment. Amongst them are the lack of context-aware models for access control, and reliance on identity or capability-based access control schemes. Additionally, the unique service access control features required in Web services technology are not captured in existing schemes. In this paper, we motivate the design of an access control scheme that addresses these issues, and propose an extended, trust-enhanced version of our XML-based Role Based Access Control (X-RBAC) framework that incorporates trust and context into access control. We outline the configuration mechanism needed to apply our model to the Web services environment, and provide a service access control specification.

In this style, thefunctional components of the system are implemented in variousprogramming languages as network-accessible ""services""declaratively specified (in WSDL) and declaratively composed in workflows (using BPEL4WS). Despite this fundamentally distributedconceptualization of service composition, most current middlewareassumes that the specification of the service composition is interpretedat run time by a central middleware node. This implies inflexiblecomposition evolution: all parties must be updated concurrently to avoid interaction failures.

370586,Web Service Enablement of Communication Services.,"In this paper, we introduce Web Service Application SessionServices, WS-Session, for Web service based application sessionmanagement in communication. A two-way Web service frameworkis described. It supports the use of Web service in the situation of telecommunication where the communication endpoint can be botha client and a peer-to-peer server. We describe the interface designin two-way Web service interaction based on the concept of tightlycoupled interface and loosely coupled interface solutions. The proposed approach provides full support of asynchronous outboundoperations and event notifications in communication services. It isimplemented in a research prototype system that provides bothstandard based (ECMA-348) services and Avaya service extensions.In addition, we investigated the integration of our proposed approachwith BPEL4WS. It allows the user to create new services through adrag-n-drop based service creation environment (ECLIPSE/BPEL4WS).It leads to a paradigm of service creation through Web service composition.More sophisticated telecommunication services are created fromcomposing the basic services.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

This is particularlytrue for healthcare applications. Modern non-invasiveunobtrusive sensors enable sophisticated monitoring ofthe human body. As a result of this monitoring a growingamount of elderly people suffering from chronic diseaseswill benefit from an enhanced quality of life and improvedtreatment. Healthcare applications process a vastamount of continuously generated data, this has becomea serious challenge. Data stream managementaddresses this problem in general. However, healthcare applicationshave additional requirements, e.g., flexibilityand reliability. As a consequence, we propose the combinationof a sophisticated information infrastructure,called hyperdatabase, and data stream management. Hyperdatabasesalready allow for reliable process managementin a peer-to-peer fashion. In this paper, we elaboratethe close relation between distributed process managementand data stream management. Further, we show thatdata stream processing can significantly benefit from an infrastructurefor reliable process management.

IDSim services can be extended throughinheritance to add or extend operations tailored to theneeds of specific simulation domains. XML-baseddocumentation of simulation models allows theframework to operate upon the contents of sharedevents (e.g., content-based distribution). Additionally,exposure of the underlying framework through GridWeb Services Description Language (GWSDL) allowsfor tool-based extensibility; that is, tools can bedeveloped to create and manage complex federations.This paper presents the design and architecture ofIDSim with a focus on extensibility; other designconcepts are presented where relevant.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

For this objective, three applications are developed and integrated by usinga service-oriented architecture: a biometric attendance system, asurveillance system, and a point of sale system. Each application is classified by a combination of two properties: input or output heavyapplication, local or remote running application. Based upon thecombination, two types of service-oriented integration approach, fullyor partially web serviced integration, are suggested according to theextent of the usage of web services.

Current web service technology encourages aclient to reveal all its attributes in a standard credential to the service provider for trust establishment. We propose a mechanismwhereby the client formulates a single trust primitive by associatinga subset of required attributes in a standard credential to negotiatea trust relationship. Client privacy is preserved because only those required attributes are revealed. After negotiation, a trustgroup element with dynamic validation is used to represent thistrust relationship.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

The mainfeature of our new approach is the elimination of acentral coordination site running the queries and theautonomic query execution. Moreover, controlinformation is embedded with the request for data, andalso with the partial results in an XML document. ThisXML document indicates the next service to be requested,the target site (if known) and how should it process anypartial results.

The tool supportsverification of properties created from design specifications and implementation models to confirm expected results from the viewpointsof both the designer and implementer. Scenarios are modeled in UML,in the form of Message Sequence Charts (MSCs), and then compiledinto the Finite State Process (FSP) algebra to concisely model the required behavior. BPEL4WS implementations are mechanicallytranslated to FSP to allow an equivalence trace verification process tobe performed. By providing early design verification and validation, the implementation, testing and deployment of web service compositionscan be eased through the understanding of the behavior exhibited bythe composition. The tool is implemented as a plug-in for the Eclipsedevelopment environment providing cooperating tools for specification, formal modeling and trace animation of the composition process.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370604,QoS-Aware Replanning of Composite Web Services.,"Run-time service discovery and late-binding constitute some ofthe most challenging issues of service-oriented software engineering.For late-binding to be effective in the case of composite services,a QoS-aware composition mechanism is needed. This meansdetermining the set of services that, once composed, not only willperform the required functionality, but also will best contribute toachieve the level of QoS promised in Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, QoS-aware composition relies on estimated QoS values and workflow execution paths previously obtained using a monitoring mechanism. At run-time, the actual QoS valuesmay deviate from the estimations, or the execution path may not bethe one foreseen. These changes could increase the risk of breakingSLAs and obtaining a poor QoS. Such a risk could be avoided byreplanning the service bindings of the workflow slice still to be executed. This paper proposes an approach to trigger and perform compositeservice replanning during execution. An evaluation has been performedsimulating execution and replanning on a set of composite serviceworkflows.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

370606,A Non-Invasive Approach to Dynamic Web Services Provisioning.,"Service-oriented computing has emerged as a new component-basedsoftware development paradigm in a network-centric environment. Byusing a standard description language and protocol, services can beused to wrap legacy software systems to be integrated beyond theenterprise boundary across heterogeneous platforms. Nevertheless, thechallenges come in tandem with the opportunities because of the inherentdynamic characteristics within a distributed environment. In particular,there is a need for dynamic adaptation for provisioned services toaccommodate the ever-changing business requirements externally as wellas the computing resource status internally, while maintaining thecontinuousness of service provisioning. We present a dynamic WebService provisioning approach based on .NET Common Language Runtime,one of the two primary Web Services platforms, exploring the runtime codemanipulation at the Intermediate Language (IL) level rather than at thesource code level. Meanwhile, we show how the service provisioning canbe adapted in a modularized way by complementing the conventionalService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with a repository of adaptationaspects. Moreover, we demonstrate how dynamic service provisioningcan be used for non-functional property assurance.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370607,Realizability of Conversation Protocols With Message Contents.,"A conversation protocol is a top-down specificationframework which specifies desired global behaviorsof a web service composition. In our earlier work [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services]we studied the problem of realizability, i.e., given a conversationprotocol, can a web service composition besynthesized to generate behaviors as specified by the protocol.Several sufficient realizability conditions were proposedin [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services] to ensure realizability. Conversation protocolsstudied in [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services], however, are essentially abstract controlflows without data semantics. This paper extends thework in [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services] and achieves more accurate analysis by consideringdata semantics. To overcome the state-spaceexplosion caused by the data content, we propose a symbolicanalysis technique for each realizability condition.In addition, we show that the analysis of the autonomycondition can be done using an iterative refinement approach.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

BPEL is the upcoming standard for web servicecomposition and several implementations of it are already available. However, for web service composition languages to keep theirpromises it is essential to provide more support for security. Companieswill embrace web service composition languages only if theirrequirements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, etc. are fulfilled. In this paper, we look at security in web services compositions andpresent a framework for securing BPEL compositions using WS-Securityand WS-Policy. The main components of our framework are theprocess container implemented by a set of aspects in AO4BPEL, anaspectoriented extension to BPEL, the security service and the deployment descriptor.

RAWSallows both the dynamic modification of the definitionand implementation structure of the Web service, andthe dynamic modification of the Web service behaviorin order to change the existing code or to add newfunctionalities.

A Web serviceis a software system that supports interoperable application-to- application interaction over the Internet. Web services are basedon a set of XML standards such as Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP). The interactions of SOAP messages between Web servicesform the theoretical model of SOAP Message Exchange Patterns (MEP). Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL)defines an interoperable integration model that facilitates automatedprocess integration in intra- and inter-corporate environments. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a Webservices requestor and provider guaranteeing quantifiable issues atdefined levels only through mutual concessions. Based on a priorresearch work on Message Detail Record (MDR), this paper further proposes a SOAP message tracking model for supporting QoSend-to-end management in the context of WSBPEL and SLA.

In this paper,we present a novel e-commerce prototype application thatitself would not be feasible without the leverage providedby underlying Web services technologies for flexible designand rapid prototyping. The application is a Model-drivenService Brokerage that allows service providers to model,advertise, validate, and create a wide range of services(e.g. Internet access services such as DSL, and Cable,Video-on-demand, etc) in an open marketplace in anautomated fashion. The application answers real needsexpressed by today's large Service Providers and goesbeyond the current state-of-the-art in onlinecommunication marketplaces. It consists of severalfunctional components - i.e. a service dependency modelingtool, brokerage engine, location services, and workflowengine - that have been independently developed on diverseplatforms, e.g., J2EE, .NET. To efficiently integrate thesecomponents, we have designed a distributed Web servicesarchitecture, in which one Web Service functions as a""hub"" between previously disconnected components,another works as a ""wrapper"" of legacy data systems,while another ""orchestrates"" invocations of these services.Use of Web services has enabled parallel and independentdevelopment and testing, greatly increasing productivityand reducing time to get the system operational.

Protocols can be published, enablingimplementors to independently develop components that respectpublished protocols and yet serve diverse interests. A varietyof business protocols would be needed to capture subtle businessneeds. We propose that the same kinds of conceptual abstractionsbe developed for protocols as for information models. Specifically,we consider (1) refinement: a subprotocol may satisfy the requirementsof a superprotocol, but support additional properties; and(2) aggregation: a protocol may combine existing protocols. Insupport of the above, this paper develops a semantics of protocolsand an operational characterization of them. This supports judgmentsabout the potential subclass-superclass relations betweenprotocols, which are a result of protocol refinement.

We propose a, XML-based language to describeinformation extraction Web Services as the compositionsof existing Web Services and specific functions. Theusefulness the proposed framework is demonstrated by threereal world applications.

370650,Modelling Inter-organizational Workflow Security in a Peer-to-Peer Environment.,"The many conflicting technical, organizational, legal and domain-level constraints make the implementation of secure, inter-organizational workflows a very complex task, which is bound to low-level technical knowledge and error prone. The SECTINO project provides a framework for the realization and the high-level management of security-critical workflows based on the paradigm of Model Driven Security. In our case the models are translated into runtime artefacts that configure a target reference architecture based on web services technologies. In this paper we focus on the Global Workflow Model, which captures the message exchange protocol between partners cooperating in a distributed environments well as basic security patterns. We show how the model maps to workflow and security components of the hosting environments at the partner nodes.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

We analyse the require- ments from this domain and show that to fully address interoperabilitydemands we need to make use of semantic descriptions of Web Services. We therefore introduce the Web Service Execution Environment (WSMX), a software system that enables the creation and executionof Semantic Web Services based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology.Providers can use it to register and offer their services and requesterscan use it to dynamically discover and invoke relevant services. WSMX allows a requester to discover, mediate and invoke Web Services in orderto carry out its tasks, based on services available on the Internet.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

We provide a higher level of abstractionthan this for higher reuse. We express high-level ""patterns""(e.g., ""SearchAndCollectData"") as both objects that canbe ""specialized"" to particular applications (""SearchAnd-DownloadPapers""vs. ""SearchAndAddBooksInCart"") andobjects that are reusable in the construction of higher-levelones. Our approach lets developers write patterns interms of high-level functionalities (e.g., ""CollectData"") andlater decide on services to compose that have lower-levelfunctionalities (e.g., ""DownloadPapers"" or ""addBooksIn-Carts"").We describe our prototype and show an exampleof nested pattern specialization. We also discuss a reusetrade-off, showing that too much abstraction makes the patternless expressive. Rather, we suggest developers capturewhat must be guaranteed in every context of invocation, regardlessof the service selection.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Web services are based on a set ofXML standards such as Universal Description, Discoveryand Integration (UDDI), Web Services DescriptionLanguage (WSDL), and Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP). Recently there are increasing demands anddiscussions about Web services privacy technologies inthe industry and research community. In general, privacypolicies describe an organization's data practices whatinformation they collect from individuals (e.g., consumers)and what (e.g., purposes) they do with it. To enableprivacy protection for Web service consumers acrossmultiple domains and services, the World Wide WebConsortium (W3C) published a document called ""WebServices Architecture (WSA) Requirements"" that definessome specific privacy requirements for Web services as afuture research topic.

370674,Web Service Gateway - A Step Forward to E-Business.,"Business-to-Business will be a considerable market inthe near future of Internet e-business. In this future market,several providers need to be able to integrate or exchangeinformation in providing a global service. The problemthat we want to tackle in this paper is related to theexisting information sources in the current Internetenvironment. That is how to integrate existing Web siteseach other to become a new Internet service ? Thedifficulty comes from a historical objective. Internet Websites were developed for human users browsing and so,they do not support machine-understandable as well asinter-provider interaction. To overcome this gap, we needa framework to systematically migrate the existingpresentation-oriented Web sites to service-oriented one.Evidently, redeveloping all of them is an unacceptablesolution.In this paper, we propose a mechanism of Web Servicegateway in which existing Web sites are wrapped byseveral Web Service wrappers. Thus, without any effortsto duplicate the Web sites code, these services inherit allfeatures from the sites while can be enriched with otherWeb Service features like UDDI publishing, semanticdescribing, etc... As a consequence, they can be easilyintegrated each-other in a Business-to-Business schema toprovide a more valuable service for users.This Web Service gateway was developed in Toshibawith Web Service Generator, allowing automaticallygenerate Web Service wrappers. By using this system,several ""real"" Web services were generated and madeavailable for use. The Web Service gateway and theseservices are also presented and evaluated in this paper.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Conventional service invocation mechanismidentifies Web services with similar signatures foundby a service discovery as distinctively different ones, resultingin the suspension of a service requester and the modificationof its invocation procedures. In this paper, we proposea reasonable solution to realize runtime invocationof Web services, regarding structural similarities in servicesignatures as subsumption relations of XML scheme.Given Web services with subsumed signatures, this solutionenables a service requester to invoke the Web services bytranslating the scheme types of the invocation parameters.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Taking intoconsideration that XPath is used to extract data from Web Servicemessages, the target element may be in the first part of documents, such as the SOAP Headers. Therefore, it is wasteful to parse adocument all the way to the end. We present a new XPath enginenamed ""XScope,"" which eliminates parsing XML documents bySchema information. In this paper, we describe the XScope approach,then evaluate its performance and show that the engine works effectivelyin Web Services.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

We illustrate an architecture anddescribe some applications. Since increased flexibility often mitigates against security and performance, we focus on steps for provingsecurity properties and measuring the performance of our system withits security operations. In particular, we demonstrate an automated proofusing TulaFale and ProVerif of a correspondence theorem for anapplication called on-demand attachments.

In a succeeding selection, for each task a trader chooses one candidate to form the optimal composition due to selection criteria. This paper discusses how the selection can consider different Quality-of-Service (QoS) categories to determine the mostsuitable candidates for the composition.

Wemodel the individual transactions as a Prisoners' Dilemma,where two players either cooperate or defect whilemaintaining each other's anonymity. The activities of theparticipants over a series of transactions can be modeledas a sequential repeated game.

370697,Batch is Back: CasJobs Serving Multi-TB Data on the Web.,"The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) science database describesover 230 million objects and is over 1.6 TB in size. The SDSS CatalogArchive Server (CAS) provides several levels of query interface tothe SDSS data via the SkyServer website. Most queries execute inseconds or minutes. However, some queries can take hours or days,either because they require non-index scans of the largest tables, orbecause they request very large result sets, or because they representvery complex aggregations of the data. These ""monster queries"" notonly take a long time, they also affect response times for everyone else-- one or more of them can clog the entire system. To ameliorate thisproblem, we developed a multi-server multi-queue batch job submission,execution, and tracking system for the CAS called CasJobs. The transferof very large result sets from queries over the network is another seriousproblem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer is unnecessary;users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow further joinsand filtering. To allow local analysis, a system was developed that givesusers their own personal databases (MyDB) at the server side. Usersmay transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis beforeextracting it to their own machine. MyDB tables also provide a convenientway to share results of queries with collaborators without downloadingthem.

We present an approach thatprovides UML-based support to design and validate WSDLdescriptions. To promote Web service interoperability, WS -I organization provides a Basic Profile that defines clarifications,refinements, interpretations and amplifications of Web servicespecifications, including WSDL. We propose UML-based profiles to define structural rules of WSDL documents as well as Basic Profilerecommendations for WSDL descriptions.

Reputation, a widelyacknowledged non-functional QoS attribute is currentlyexpressed as the average of user ratings given to the service.However, this expression confines reputation to the subjectiveperception of the end user and is limited by the lack of anobjective representation of performance history. In this paper,we address the need for a reputation mechanism that couplesthe subjective perception of the end user with the objectiveview of performance history. To represent performance history,we propose a novel QoS metric termed verity. Verity measuresthe degree of consistency exhibited by the service provider indelivering the quality levels laid out in the service contract,over a range of previous transactions. We express reputationas a composition of user rating, the compliance levels exhibitedby the provider and the verity value.

The use of proposed web services is motivated by the fact that the problem of 3D medical volume reconstruction requires significant computer resources and human expertise in medical and computer science areas. Web services are implemented as an additional layer to a dataflow framework called data to knowledge. In the collaboration between UIC and NCSA, pre-processed input images at NCSA are made accessible to medical collaborators for registration. Every time UIC medical collaborators inspected images and selected corresponding features for registration, the web service at NCSA is contacted and the registration processing query is executed using the image to knowledge library of registration methods. Co-registered frames are returned for verification by medical collaborators in a new window. In this paper, we present 3D volume reconstruction problem requirements and the architecture of the developed prototype system at http://isda.ncsa.uiuc.edu/MedVolume. We also explain the tradeoffs of our system design and provide experimental data to support our system implementation.

For instance, a Java program must be executed using a Java VM. This limitation is particularly harmful for the emergence of a new programming paradigm like SOA and Web Services because platforms for new innovative programming languages are typically not as stable and mature as the established platforms for traditional programming paradigms. The purpose of this work is to break the strong ties between programming languages and runtime environments and thus make it possible to innovate at both ends independently. Thereby, the specific focus is on Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures; focusing on this domain makes it possible to achieve this goal with affordable efforts. The key idea is to introduce a Service Language Layer (SLL) which gives a high-level abstraction of a service-oriented program and which can easily and efficiently be executed on alternative Web Services platforms.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

This matching semantics can be formalized bymeans of modelling complex services as finite state automata (FSAs),and analysing the intersection of the FSAs. However, computingthe intersection of FSAs is computationally expensive, and thus does not scale for large service repositories. This paper presentsan approach for indexing and matching complex services using anabstraction that transforms the underlying FSA via its grammar intoa form that can be indexed using available index mechanisms.Evaluation of this approach shows a performance gain of severalorders of magnitude as compared to sequential matching.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

370727,Provisioning Resilient Adaptive Web Services-based Workflow: A Semantic Modeling Approach.,"Web Services are emerging technologies that enableapplication-to-application communication andreuse of autonomous services over the Web. Recent efforts,OWL-S, model the semantics of Web Services thatincludes the capabilities of the service, the service interactionprotocol, and the actual messages for serviceexchanges. However, there is a need to automate discovery,selection and execution of OWL-S services. Further, aframework that meets the quality of service (QoS) requirementsfor ad hoc Internet based services is rarely provided.In this paper, we have proposed a rule-based framework,called SemWebQ, which manages workflows composedof Semantic Web Services. SemWebQ is capable ofconducting QoS-based adaptive selection as well as dynamicbinding and execution of Web Services accordingto the semantics of workflow, thereby rendering a resilientand adaptive Web based service flow. A series ofexperiments performed on the SemWebQ with real Web Serviceshave confirmed the effectiveness of proposed frameworkwith respect to adaptive selection and execution ofthe Web Services in Web based workflows.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

370729,Autonomic Execution of Web Service Compositions.,"An increasing amount of Web services are being implemented using process management tools and languages (BPML, BPEL, etc.). The main advantage of processes is that designers canexpress complex business conversations at a high level ofabstraction, even reusing standardized business protocols. Thedownside is that the infrastructure behind the Web service becomesmore complex. This is particularly critical for Web services that may be subjected to high variability in demand and suffer from unpredictable peaks of heavy load. In this paper we present a flexible architecture for process execution that has been designed to support autonomicscalability. The system runs on a cluster of computers and reacts toworkload variations by altering its configuration in order to optimallyuse the available resources. Such changes happen automaticallyand without any human intervention. This feature completely removesthe need for the manual monitoring and reconfiguration of the system,which in practice is a difficult and time-consuming operation. In thepaper we describe the architecture of the system and present anextensive performance evaluation of its autonomic capabilities.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

Web services streamlineenterprise application integration by making it easierto tie applications running on heterogeneous platformstogether helping them communicate correctly,effectively and at reduced cost. The difficulty ofintegration is a function of the level of interoperabilitybetween the applications being integrated. Eventhough there are established standards for webservices messaging (SOAP), description (WSDL) anddiscovery and registry (UDDI), customimplementations of these protocols by individualvendors has led to various interoperability issues. WebServices Interoperability Organization (WS-I) recentlyreleased Basic Profile 1.0, addressing theinteroperability issues with core web servicesstandards. In this paper, we look at some of the keyweb services interoperability issues pointed out bypractitioners and critically examine how Basic Profile1.0 addresses them. Further we also examine somelimitations of the profile. We conclude by evaluating apopular web services implementation against theprofile and present our observations.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Thedomain-specific ontological similarity is derived by an inferenceon the semantic annotations associated with web service descriptions.Matches due to the two cues are combined to determine an overall semantic similarity score.

Widely adopted, distributor-basedsystems forward client requests to a balanced set of backendservers in complete transparency to the clients. In this paper,we use power and locality-based request distribution at the distributor to provide optimum power conservation, whilemaintaining the required QoS of the system. The distributionscheme uses a simple memory management technique using pinned memory on the backend servers and proactive distribution,with the aid of data organization of the website, to improve the locality of the files. A simple on-off based power managementscheme is applied to conserve power. Our scheme provides reducedresponse time to the clients and improved power conservation atthe backend server cluster without compromising performance.

370771,Mobile Code Enabled Web Services.,"A primary benefit of Web Services is that they provide a uniformimplementation-independent mechanism for accessing distributedservices. Building and deploying such services do not benefit fromthe same advantages, however. Different Web Services containersare implemented in different programming languages, with differentconstraints and requirements placed on the programmer. Moreover,client side programmers must use the Web Service interface specifiedby the service developer. Therefore, the kinds of applications and uses for a Web Service are unnecessarily restrictive, constrained bythe granularity of access defined by the interface and by thecharacteristics of the service functions. This paper describes anapproach that addresses both of these drawbacks by enabling Web Service containers with the ability to accept new mobile code on the fly,and to run it within the containers, providing direct local access to the containers' other services. The code can be specified in a small simplelanguage (a subset of C), and translated and passed to the container ina common XML-based intermediate language called X#.

In the future, it isexpected that a usage model that autonomouslyintegrates services will become ordinary in, forexample, B2B integration. However, such method ofexecuting pre-defined process lacks flexibility becausea service requestor must know in advance the interfaceof all integrated services. Accordingly, there is a needfor a method that composes a process from therequestor's requirement independent of the interface ofservices.This paper proposes the architecture and a methodfor composing a process automatically. Our approachis formulating web services function and a requestor'srequirement as the transitions of his state by means ofsituation calculus and calculating what process ismatched with the requirement. In our method, wemodel message-oriented execution of service.Moreover, our method is capable of composing not justa sequential process but also a process includingconditional choices.

One legitimate questionis therefore whether the formal approach and the sophisticatedtools introduced for process algebra can be used to improve theeffectiveness and the reliability of web service development. Ourinvestigations suggest a positive answer, and we claim that processalgebras provide a very complete and satisfactory assistanceto the whole process of web service development.

370789,Attributed Based Access Control (ABAC) for Web Services.,"For companies and government agencies alike, the emergence ofWeb services technologies and the evolution of distributed systemstoward Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) have helped promote collaboration and information sharing by breaking down ""stove-piped""systems and connecting them via loosely coupled, interoperablesystem-to-system interfaces. Such architectures, however, also bring about their own security challenges that require due consideration. Unfortunately, the current information security mechanisms are insufficientto address thesechallenges. In particular, the access control models today are mostly static and coarsely grained; they are not well-suitedfor the service-oriented environments where information access isdynamic and ad-hoc in nature. This paper outlines the access control challenges for Web services and SOA, and proposes an Attribute BasedAccess Control (ABAC) model as a new approach, which is based onsubject, object, and environment attributes and supports both mandatory and discretionary access control needs. The paper describes the ABAC model in terms of its authorizationarchitecture and policy formulation, and makes a detailed comparison between ABAC and traditional role-based models, which clearly showsthe advantages of ABAC. The paper then describes how this newmodel can be applied to securing web service invocations, with animplementation based on standard protocols and open-source tools.The paper concludes with a summary of the ABAC modelÃ_s benefits and some future directions.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

After providingan introduction to Web Service technology, this contribution primarily aims to describe the topic of servicelevel agreements (short SLA) management in such environments.In this context, we will highlight the general contents of SLA agreements,describe the interaction chain for service provision that arises in Web-service-based solutions, and provide a brief explanation of the opportunities offered by the WSLA framework that IBM has developed especially for Web Services. Finally we describe the conception, prototypical development and the possible application of a measurement service for monitoring the quality behavior of an specific Web Service. This measurement service can be used to support service level agreements.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

From theworking research prototype, our proposed mechanismenables businesses to easily retrieve up-to-date Webservices linked and nested multi-level deep in the servicedescription documents.

370793,Scalable Peer-to-Peer Process Management - The OSIRIS Approach.,"The functionality of applications is increasingly beingmade available by services. General concepts and standardslike SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI support the discoveryand invocation of single web services. State-of-the-art process management is conceptually based on a centralizedprocess manager. The resources of this coordinatorlimit the number of concurrent process executions, especiallysince the coordinator has to persistently store eachstate change for recovery purposes. In this paper, we overcomethis limitation by executing processes in a peer-to-peerway exploiting all nodes of the system. By distributingthe execution and navigation costs, we can achieve a higherdegree of scalability allowing for a much larger throughputof processes compared to centralized solutions. This papersdescribes our prototype system OSIRIS, which implementssuch a true peer-to-peer process execution. We furtherpresent very promising results verifying the advantagesover centralized process management in terms of scalability.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

370795,A QoS Broker Based Architecture for Efficient Web Services Selection.,"Quality of Service (QoS) support in web services plays a great rolefor the success of this emerging technology. In this paper, wepresent a QoS brokerbased architecture for web services. Themain goal of the architecture is to support the client in selecting web services based on his/her required QoS. To achieve this goal,we propose a two-phase verification technique that is performed bya third party broker. The first phase consists of syntactic and semantic verification of the service interface description including the QoSparameters description. The second phase consists of applying ameasurement technique to compute the QoS metrics stated in theservice interface and compares their values with the claimed one.This is used to verify the conformity of a web service from the QoSpoint of view (QoS testing). A methodological approach to generateQoS test cases, as input to QoS verification is used. We haveimplemented a prototype that includes the verification and certification components of the broker. We performed experiments to evaluatethe importance of verification and certification features in the selectionprocess using real web services.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370796,A Reservation-Based Coordination Protocol for Web Services.,"Traditional transaction semantics are not appropriate for business activities that involve long-running transactions in a loosely-coupled distributed environment, in particular, for Web Services that operate between different enterprises over the Internet. In this paper we describe a novel reservation-based extended transaction protocol that can be used to coordinate such business activities. The protocol avoids the use of compensating transactions, which can result in undesirable effects. In our protocol, each task within a business activity is executed as two steps. The first step involves an explicit reservation of resources. The second step involves the confirmation or cancellation of the reservation. Each step is executed as a separate traditional short-running transaction. We show how our protocol can be implemented as a reservation protocol on top of the Web Services Transaction specification or, alternatively, as a coordination protocol on top of theWeb Services Coordination specification.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370797,A Web Service Authentication Control System Based on SRP and SAML.,"Actually Internet applications can provide not only information, butalso, another way of getting distributed computing. Cooperativeinformation systems are autonomous and heterogeneous systems, distributed geographically, but interconnected. Web Services providesa set of interoperable standards that can be used to connect distributedapplications. On this environment, security is a critical issue, and an attack can expose systems services without authentication. Anend-to-end connection, like the ones involved in such systems,usually requires that an authentication can be shared between differentinformation systems. Web Services security model is not yet fully definedand a lot of proposals are emerging, delaying the adoption of thistechnology in many situations. In this paper we present multiplatformauthentication control system based on an extension of SRP protocol,using SAML. Within this solution, authentication control can be leveraged,even with weak passwords and an authentication assertion can be exchanged with different cooperative information systems.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370798,An Adaptive Process Allocation Strategy for Proportional Responsiveness Differentiation on Web Servers.,"There is a growing demand for provisioning of differentlevels of quality of service (QoS) on scalable Web serversto meet changing resource availability and satisfy differentclient requirements. The proportional differentiation modelis getting momentum because of its fairness and differentiationpredictability. It states that QoS of different trafficclasses should be kept proportional to their pre-specifieddifferentiation parameters, independent of the class loads.In this paper, we present a processing rate allocationscheme for providing proportional response time differentiationon Web servers. A challenging issue is how to achieveprocessing rates for different request classes in the implementation.We propose a process allocation strategy, whichdynamically and adaptively changes the number of processesallocated for handling different request classes whileensuring the ratios of process allocation specified by theprocessing rate allocation scheme. We implement the processallocation strategy at application level on Apache Webservers. Experimental results show that the processing ratecan be achieved by the adaptive process allocation strategyand the Web servers can provide predictable and controllableproportional response time differentiation.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

370800,DAML-QoS Ontology for Web Services.,"As more and more Web services are deployed, Web service'sdiscovery mechanisms become essential. Similar services can havequite different QoS levels. For service selection and managementpurpose, it is necessary to explicitly, precisely, and unambiguouslyspecify various constraints and QoS metrics for Web services descriptions.This paper provides a novel DAML-QoS ontology as acomplement for DAML-S ontology to provide a better QoS metricsmodel. Three layers are defined together with clear role descriptionsfor developments. Cardinality constraints are utilizedto describe the QoS property constraints. Basic profile is presentedfor general web service's description and the speed startup of ontologydefinition. Matchmaking algorithm for QoS property constraintsis presented and different matching degrees are described.When incorporated with DAML-S, multiple service levels can bedescribed through attaching multiple QoS profiles to one serviceprofile. Well-defined Metrics can be further utilized by measurementorganizations to guarantee the promised service level.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370802,A Robust Application-Level Approach for Responsiveness Differentiation.,"There is a growing demand for provisioning of proportional responsive- ness differentiation to various clients on scalable Web servers to meetchanging resource availability and to satisfy different client requirements.Theoretically, a queueing-based processing rate allocation scheme is able to achieve the objective by providing different processing rates to requestsof different client classes. However, in this paper, we find that an implement- ation of the queueingtheoretical scheme shows weak proportionality withlarge variance because it does not have fine-grained control over theconsumption of resources that the kernel consumes and hence theprocessing rate is not strictly proportional to the number of processesallocated. We design a feedback controller and integrate it with thequeueing theoretical scheme. The integrated application-level approach allocates a certain number of processes to handle requests of differentclient classes according to the queueing-theoretical scheme. Theprocess allocations are then adjusted according to the differencebetween the target response time and the achieved response time by using the proportional integral derivative control. Results demonstrate thatthis integrated approach can enable Web servers to provide fine-grainedresponse time differentiation. The approach is robust and can bepractically deployed on Apache Web servers.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

One novelcontribution of this work is the ability to naturally handle parallelworkflow execution paths. This is essential in applications whereworkflows include multiple concurrent service calls/paths that need to be ""joined"" at a later point in time. We discuss theautomatic deployment of on-the-fly monitoring mechanisms withinthe resource management mechanisms. We implement, deployand experiment with a proof of concept within a generalized web services business process (BPEL4WS/SOAP) framework. In the experimental setup we explore and show the naturaladaptation to changing workflow conditions and appropriateautomatic re-allocation of resources to reduce execution times.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

Quality of service (QoS) issues are currently not part of the Web service standard stack, although non-functional attributes like performance, dependability or cost and payment play an important role for service discovery, selection, and composition. A lot of research is dedicated to different QoS models, at the same time omitting a way to specify how QoS parameters (esp. the performance related aspects) are assessed, evaluated and constantly monitored. Our contribution in this paper comprises a) an evaluation approach for QoS attributes of Web services, which works completely serviceand provider independent, b) a method to analyze Web service interactions by using our evaluation tool and extract important QoS information without any knowledge about the service implementation. Furthermore, our implementation allows assessing performance specific values (such as latency or service processing time) that usually require access to the server which hosts the service. The result of the evaluation process can be used to enrich existing Web service descriptions with a set of up-to-date QoS attributes, therefore, making it a valuable instrument for Web service selection.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Their range however islimited as yet by the very structure and standardizationwhich support their interoperability. While they areable to support heterogeneity of technical components,their ability to support complex business interactionshas yet to mature. This poster summarizes research inprogress which asks how might the Web Servicesmodel be mapped to other kinds of IT services andextended to account for services of greater human andorganizational complexity through their lifecycle.

However, most Web services platforms are based on a best-effort model, which treats all requests uniformly, without any type of service differentiation or prioritization. This paper presents WS-DiffServ, a service differentiation middleware based on prioritization which leverages service requestor profile to classify service requests. We first explore the typical generic requirements of a differential QoS support in Web services management. We then present in detail the design of a priority based differentiated responsiveness platform for Web services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

This is commonly referred to as discovery, wherefore theemerging concept of Semantic Web Services promises more effective support than conventional Web Service technologies: based on exhaustive semantic description frameworks, intelligentmechanisms are envisioned for discovery, composition, and contractingof Web Services.

370819,A Two Steps Method For Analyzing Dependency of Business Services On IT Services Within A Service Life Cycle.,"In order to meet the dynamic business environment, the alignment of business services and IT services has long been a challenge to both business and IT people. In this paper, a graph centric, two-phase analysis and design method for service system is proposed which is based on the recent evolutions in these fields like Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The method proposed in this paper views a service system comprising of business services and IT services as a layered complex system and uses matrices to represent the interactions between different layers. The method could help decision makers to analyze the impact of service changes during service design period. This could also facilitate the design of a more flexible IT service system reacting to business changes. The aim of this paper is to seek balance among different parts of a service system, and to provide a holistic view of the system for different role players. Results from this paper could give service designers some insights on how to design an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) in the SOA architecture of an enterprise.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370820,Modelling and Solving QoS Composition Problem Using Fuzzy DisCSP.,"Web service compositions have attracted considerable efforts in the context of supporting enterprise application integrations. For a composite service, in addition to its functional requirements, QoS requirements are important and deserve a special attention. The central question to a QoS composition problem is how to compose a service from different subcomponent services so that its overall QoS can satisfy certain requirements. In this paper, we propose an agent-based method using Fuzzy Distributed Constraint Satisfaction Problem (Fuzzy DisCSP) techniques to solve this problem. We show that by using the composition structures, local constraints can be constructed and used with DisCSP. We also present an a new algorithm called the Fuzzy constraint satisfaction Algorithm for Distributed Environment (FADE) to solve the problem and discuss our experiment in building a prototypical system to prove the feasibility of our approach.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Since current service discovery approaches do not assume any preprocessing when service providers publish services into a service registry, service composition occurs at discovery time. Also, easily reusing a composed service for future discovery has not been considered. In this paper, instead of considering a service registry as a set of published services, we build a service knowledge base at publication time, which we call a service community. The service community consists of a set of service populations and their relationships in composition. A service population is a set of services in which the input and output parameters of all services are semantically equivalent. These pre-composed services will expedite the on demand service discovery process. Also a newly composed service is injected into the service community, and easily reused for future discoveries.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

However, it is also important to be able to measure a web service in terms of how well it protects personal privacy. Such a capability would benefit both users and developers. Users would benefit from being able to choose (assuming that such measures were made public) the service that has the greatest ability to protect user privacy (this would in turn encourage web service providers to pay more attention to privacy). Developers would benefit by being able to incrementally measure and modify their services during development until certain target levels of privacy protection are reached. This paper presents an approach for measuring how well a web service protects personal privacy and illustrates the approach with an example.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

As such, the registryhas to provide high throughput, low response times, highavailability, and access to accurate data. Replication is oftenused to satisfy such requirements. Various replicationstrategies exist, favoring different subsets of the above performancemetrics. In this paper, we have a closer look attwo very different replication strategies.

Instead of using a Web Service Execution Engine running on a single host to conduct the execution of a composite service, the responsibility of conducting the execution of the composite service has been delegated to the service providers that are chosen to provide the main functionalities of the tasks in the composite service. The operations of the tasks are represented as a set of XML-based notations. The notations are platform independent. Thus, they can be (a) retrieved by service providers based on different platforms, and, (b) interpreted and executed by the service providers. The approach also provides a mechanism for coping with possible failure in the system.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370831,Optimizing Web Services Performance by Differential Deserialization.,"Web services technology has emerged as a key infrastructurethat enables business entities to interact with each other withoutany human inventions. In order for the technology to be widelyused, especially in any field where a large volume of transactionsmay be processed, it is highly desirable that the Web services engineshould tolerate such environments. In this paper, we present a novelapproach for improving Web services performance. We first focus on the fundamental characteristics of the Web services in that the SOAPmessages on the wire are mostly generated by machines and have alot of similarities among the processed messages. By making use ofthese features and eliminating the redundant processing, we propose a new deserialization mechanism that reuses matching regions fromthe previously deserialized application objects from earlier messages,and only performs deserialization for a new region that would not be processed before. Through our experiments in this paper, we observedthat our approach obtained a 288% performance gain (maximum) byincorporating the differential deserialization into the Axis SOAP engine.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370832,User Feedback-Based Refinement for Web Services Retrieval using Multiple Instance Learning.,"A critical step in the process of reusing existing WSDLspecified components is the discovery of potentially relevant Web Services. Traditional category based Web Service retrieval usually can achieve good recall but worse precision because some semantically relevant Web Services are not actually relevant as they cannot provide suitable interfaces. In this paper, we present an interactive Web Services retrieval mechanism to refine the coarse retrieval results set in category based retrieval. In the refinement, the signature matching of Web Services that concerning the structure of operation specifications is investigated from a multi-instances view. In detail, each Web Service is represented as a bag in multiple instance learning, while each operation in this Web Service is regarded as an instance. This representation lies in that a user regards a service as useful if at least one operation provided by this Web Service is useful. Experimental results show that our approach can improve the retrieval performance significantly: It can gain 83% precision in average after two rounds of user relevance feedback.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370833,Code Generation for WSLAs using AXpect.,"WSLAs can be viewed as describing the serviceaspect of web services. By their nature, web services aredistributed. Therefore, integrating support code into a webservice application is potentially costly and error prone. Viewedfrom this AOP perspective, then, we present a method forintegrating WSLAs into code generation using the AXpectweaver, the AOP technology for Infopipes. This helps to localizethe code physically and therefore increase the eventualmaintainability and enhance the reuse of the WSLA code. Wethen illustrate the weavers capability by using a WSLAdocument to codify constraints and metrics for a streamingimage application that requires CPU resource monitoring.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Thestudy of workflow model is one of the most importantparts and a key layer of Web service composition. Theexisting approaches have difficulties in modelingdynamic and complex service composition process, sowe propose a novel workflow model namedService/Resource Net (SRN) for Web servicecomposition, which is an extended Petri-net-basedmodel with some new elements, such as time, resourcetaxonomy, condition, etc. To establish formal conceptsystem of Web service taxonomy in SRN, we presentWeb service semigroup based on group theory.Moreover, meta-service is proposed based on thedefinition of generating element in cyclic monoid.

In our work, we investigate the nature of message definitions by analyzing real, fully-operational web services currently available on the Internet (i.e., from the wild).

370837,Introducing Dynamic Distributed Coordination in Web Services for Next Generation Service Platforms.,"We present a technique called Dynamic DistributedService Coordination Protocol (DDSCP) that enablesdynamic and distributed coordination for composedservices and applications in telecommunicationnetworks. Individual service components are modeledas web services and DDSCP facilitates coordinationamong these components by dispatching executableprocesses to the service components that specifydifferent steps that the service component must followin response to (receipt of) specific messages andevents. The collective and concurrent execution ofthese processes at different service componentsachieves overall goals of the service. The planningand creation of these processes is not our focus in thispaper. We describe the structure and processing ofdifferent messages DDSCP, and describe how thisprotocol can work.Our model has several advantages over the existingservice platforms for 3rd Generation Mobile Networks,such as Parlay/OSA, and the web-service compositionmodels. These advantages include introduction offlexibility among network components at finest level,ease of creation of highly customized services, easyintegration with foreign components, reducedapplication complexity, increased reuse of applicationcomponents, and possibility of increased userparticipation in managing her services, and thusreducing load on the network.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370838,WIP: Web Service Initiation Protocol for Multimedia and Voice Communication over IP.,"In this paper, we present WIP - Web Service Initiation Protocol for multimedia and voice communication over IP. WIP is an entirely web service based communication protocol, consisting of a set of web service operations for initiating and establishing converged (e.g. multimedia, IM, voice, etc.) communication services over IP. It inherits the principle of separation signaling and media transmission of SIP (Session Initiation Protocol); but it relies on a single web service stack to provide a full featured communication signaling protocol. WIP opens a new paradigm of web service based VoIP communication, which is extensible and can be easily integrated in end-to-end SOA solutions. The generic web service approach used in WIP overcomes many limitations which would be otherwise difficult to achieve in non-web service based communication methods used today. WIP is based on two-way, full duplex web service interaction. The communication signaling establishment in WIP is through web service interactions, and the media negotiation in WIP is modeled as a special web service ""event"" subscription, which is fully extensible for various media needs. The signaling messages of WIP are encoded in the standard based SOAP message envelops which can be carried by multiple transport protocols, including HTTP. WIP supports both P2P (peer-to-peer) and B2B (back-to-back) broker mode communication services. A prototype research system has been implemented, and the results indicate that WIP, as a full web service based communication protocol, is both feasible and advantageous.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370839,Best-Practice Patterns and Tool Support for Configuring Secure Web Services Messaging.,"This paper presents an emerging tool for securityconfiguration of service-oriented architectures with WebServices. Security is a major concern when implementingmission-critical business transactions and such concernmotivated the development of Web Services Security(WS-Security). However, the existing tools for configuringthe security properties of Web Services give atechnology-oriented view, and only assist in choosingthe data to encrypt and selecting an encryption algorithm.The users must construct their own mental modelsof how the security configurations actually relate tobusiness policies.In contrast, the tool described here gives a simplified,business-policy-oriented view. It models the messagingwith customers and business partners, lists variousthreats, and presents best-practice security patternsagainst the threats. A user can select among variationson the basic patterns according to the business policies,and then apply them to the messaging model through theGUI. The result of the pattern application is describedin the Web Services Security Policy Language (WS-SecurityPolicy).",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

370841,Analysis of Transport Optimization Techniques.,"The popularity of Web-based transactions and the need for more sophisticated content distribution methods has helped to fuel the rapid growth of Web Service adoption, specifically, HTTP-bound Web Services. Secure and efficient content delivery has long been a requirement of traditional Web-based distribution schemes, and existing the Web infrastructure provides numerous options for securing and optimizing HTTP. Two exemplary technologies are SSL/TLS and HTTP compression. While efforts to solidify the more granular WSSecurity standards are ongoing, and methods for XML message compression schemes continue to be investigated, HTTP provides an interim solution, supporting transactional security and message compression. The SSL/TLS and HTTP compression technologies have become commoditized and pervasive. And with the trend in content delivery toward hardware offload for these functions, modern data centers have begun to raise the bar for performance. In this paper, we examine three different paradigms for implementing SSL/TLS and HTTP compression: softwarebased functionality, server-resident hardware accelerators, and centralized network-resident hardware accelerators. We discuss the trade-offs between the two different offload techniques (i.e., PCI accelerator vs. network proxy) and explore their relationship to the current performance activities, in the field of Web Services. In analyzing the results for SSL/TLS offload, and the effects of compression, in conjunction with SSL/TLS, we draw parallels with the efforts of WS-Security and XML message compression. Although optimizations for software-based cryptography will continue to advance, the potential for hardware-based acceleration should not be overlooked. We discuss our results and address deployment scenarios for optimizingWeb-based transactions, and the future optimization of Web Service transactions.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370842,Grid Resources for Industrial Applications.,"We introduce Grid Resources for IndustrialApplications (GRIA), a project that aims to enablecommercial use of the Grid. GRIA enables serviceproviders to rent out spare CPU cycles, and clients tohire those CPU cycles. Web services play a key role in thearchitecture of GRIA, chiefly through theirinteroperability and security features - they provide awell-defined means of limiting clients' access to discreteoperations, thus allowing clients to do ""work"" on aremote application server without giving them full shellaccess to the server. In this paper, we focus onrequirements, business processes and security, andinteroperability and standardisation issues raised by thiswork. We also describe some of the lessons learnedthrough experience of designing, implementing anddeploying a prototype system, GRIA v1.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370843,A Transaction Model for Service Grid Environment and Implementation Considerations.,"Transaction concept plays a key role in business success. However, existing transaction models are not applicable in service grid environment. Though many new models have been suggested, they still have some deficiencies, e.g., major extension to services are required, and they are hard to implement, to name a few. In this paper, a new model is proposed based on the analysis of existing work and the characteristics of service grid environment. Besides, model implementation issues are also covered.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

BSNs are Internet business communities where companies collaborate through loosely coupled business services. Participants register business services (e.g., place an order, make a payment) that others can discover and incorporate into their own business processes with a few clicks of a mouse. Companies can build on each other's services, creating new services and linking them into industry-transforming, network-centric business models. We also discuss evolution of BSNs since early 1990's, emerging technological underpinnings, and CommerceNet's role in catalyzing their adoption.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Organizations may be able to leverage this SOC paradigm if their employees are able to ubiquitously incorporate such capabilities and their resulting information into their daily practices. It is impractical to assume that human users will be able to search vast distributed repositories at real-time. In addition, automated search tools may invasively present too much information. This paper presents an architecture, Software Agent-Based Groupware using Eservices (SAGE), that incorporates the use of intelligent agents to integrate human users with web services. SAGE provides background search and discovery approaches thus enabling human users to exploit service-based capabilities that were previously too time-consuming to locate and integrate. We present a multi-agent system where each agent learns the rule-based preferences of a human user and manages the incorporation of web services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370849,A Model-Driven Approach for Specifying Semantic Web Services.,"The semantic web promises automated invocation, discovery, andcomposition of web services by enhancing services with semanticdescriptions. One such language used for creating semantic descriptionsis the Web Ontology Language or OWL. An upper ontology for webservices called OWL-S has been created to provide a mechanismfor describing service semantics in a standard, well-defined manner. Unfortunately, the learning curve for semantic-rich description languages such as OWL-S can be steep, especially with given thecurrent state of tool support for the language. This paper describesan automated software tool that uses model-driven architecture (MDA)techniques to generate an OWL-S description of a web service froma UML model. This allows the developer to focus on creating a model of the web service in a standard UML tool, leveraging existing knowledge.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

Hence there will soon be a need for integration of these heterogeneous services, for the development of service-oriented applications. The first step to accomplish this is to establish a unified approach for service discovery. In this paper, we briefly present a query language along with its enacting service search engine which is used for effectively discovering web and p2p services in a unified manner.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

While this provides excellent functionality to non-expert users, more sophisticated middleware is required to hide the details of service invocation and service integration. An investigation of a common Bioinformatics use case reveals that the execution of high-level workflow designs requires additional processing to harmonise syntactically incompatible service interfaces. In this paper, we present an architecture to support the automatic reconciliation of data formats in such Web Service worklflows. The mediation of data is driven by ontologies that encapsulate the information contained in heterogeneous data structures supplying a common, conceptual data representation. Data conversion is carried out by a Configurable Mediator component, consuming mappings between XML schemas and OWL ontologies. We describe our system and give examples of our mapping language against the background of a Bioinformatics use case.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370861,Web-Service Semantic Enabled Implementation of Machine vs.Machine Business Negotiation.,"The ultimate target of business to business (B2B) integration and deployment is completebusiness process automation within and between enterprises with no human intervention.From a business point of view, negotiation is the main mechanism that modern enterprises use to achieve targets that maximise their profits. This paper proposes an automated B2B negotiation solution: the implementation of semantic-enabled machine versus machine business negotiation as a web service. We argue that the shift from human vs. human to machine vs. machine business negotiation is facilitated by using semantic web technology implemented with web services. The negotiation process in this work is designed for multiple machines (a minimum of 3 computers), using a negotiation algorithm that emulates the behaviour of human business negotiations. Possible development directions are brought forward in the paper's conclusion.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370862,Indexing Business Processes based on Annotated Finite State Automata.,"The existing service discovery infrastructure with UDDI as the de facto standard, is limited in that it does not support more complex searching based on matching business processes. Two business processes match if they agree on their simple services, theirprocessesing order as well as any mandatory or optional requirements for the service. This matching semanctics can be formalized by modelling business processes as annotated finite state autamata (aFSAs) and deciding emptiness of intersection aFSA. Computing the intersection of aFSAs and deciding emptiness are computationally expensive, being more than quadratic on the number of states and transistions, thusdoes not scale for large service repositories. This paper presents an approach for indexing and matching business processes modeled as aFSAs, for the purpose of service directory. Evaluation of this approach shows a preformance gain of several orders of magnitude over sequential matching and linear complexity with regard to the data size.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370863,CredEx: User-Centric Credential Management for Grid and Web Services.,"User authentication is a crucial security component for most computingsystems. But since the security needs of different systems vary widely,authentication mechanisms are similarly diverse. In particular,independently managed Web and Grid Services vary with regardto the type of security token (credential) used to prove user identity(username/password, X.509 signing, Kerberos, etc.). Forcing usersto manage and present credentials manually for each service istedious, error-prone and potentially insecure. In contrast, we presentCredEx, an open-source, standards-based Web Service that facilitates the secure storage of credentials and enables the dynamic exchangeof different credential types using the WS-Trust token exchangeprotocol. With CredEx, a user can achieve single sign-on by acquiringa single (default) credential then dynamically exchanging that credentialas needed for services that authenticate a different way. We describethe design and implementation of CredEx by focusing on its use inbridging password-based Web Services and PKI-based Grid Services,illustrating how interoperability between these realms can be basedupon the WS-Security and WS-Trust specifications.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

The aim is towards flexible coordination, managed at run-time, in open, dynamic environments. This approach would benefit from an explicit common vocabulary for coordination and hence, in a previous paper, we modelled coordination in an ontology, describing the activities carried out and the interdependencies among these activities. The purpose of this paper is to show how such an ontology can be used alongside a set of rules to perform coordination by managing the interdependencies among activities. The ontology and rules can then be used to provide a general purpose coordination tool in the form of a web service.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

However,while industry standards for the description, composition,and orchestration of Web services have been under discussion(and development) for quite some time already, theirconceptual underpinnings are still in their infancy. Indeed,conceptual models for service specification are rare so far,as are investigations based on them. This paper presents amulti-level service composition model that perceives servicespecification as going through several levels of abstraction,from transactional operations to the end user.Importantly, the model allows for specification of desirablecomposition properties at all levels. Different ways ofachieving these properties as well as implications of themodel are addressed.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370869,Service Congestion: The Problem and an Optimized Service Composition Architecture as a Solution.,"Web services have many important advantages. But their great drawback, the invocation overhead, has not been a research focus. So far, only invocations of simple Web services were considered. But Web service composition may create additional performance problems. Our measurements demonstrate that Web service composition may reduce the maximal load of a system drastically. The reduction quotient increases quasi-exponentially with the number of service compositions. We call that phenomenon ""service congestion"" since it is not due to the combined payload of the composed services. Such detrimental performance effects can not be tolerated in many areas. For that reason, we propose an optimized service composition architecture as a solution. This service component architecture uses service connectors on top of standard Web service middleware. It optimizes automatically the local invocation of services with a Lookup & Service bus. The result is that no service congestion occurs since local service invocations have the cost of local calls.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

We believe our web service is the first available online measurement tool for ontology comparison.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370873,Compressing SOAP Messages by using Pushdown Automata.,"In environments with limited network bandwidth or resource-constrained computing devices the high amount of protocol overhead caused by SOAP is disadvantageous. Therefore, recent research work concentrated on more compact, binary representations of XML data. However, due to the special characteristics of SOAP communication most of these approaches are not applicable in the field of web services. First, we give a detailed overview of the latest developments in the field of XML data compression. Then we will introduce a new approach for compressing SOAP data which utilizes information on the structure of the data from an XML Schema or WSDL document to generate a single custom pushdown automaton. This cannot only be used as a highly efficient validating parser but also as a compressor: its transitions are tagged with short binary identifiers which replace XML tags during compression. This approach leads to extremely compact data representations as well as low memory and CPU utilization.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370874,Extending the Security Assertion Markup Language to Support Delegation for Web Services and Grid Services.,"Users of Web and Grid Services often must temporarily delegate someor all of their rights to a software entity to perform actions on their behalf.The problem with the typical Grid Services approach (X.509 proxycertificates) is that commercial Web Services tooling fails to recognize these certificates or process them properly. The Security Assertion MarkupLanguage (SAML) is a standardized XML-based framework for exchangingauthentication, authorization and attribute information. SAML has broadening commercial support but lacks delegation capabilities.To address this shortcoming, we exploit SAML's inherent extensibilityto create a delegation framework for Web and Grid Services that supportsboth direct and indirect delegation. We develop a set of verification rulesfor delegation tokens that rely on WSSecurity X.509 signatures, but donot force any trust relationship between the delegatee and the targetservice. We have implemented the framework on two common Web Service hosting environments: Java/Tomcat and .NET. By leveragingexisting Web Services standards, we make it easier for Grid practitionersto build and consume Web and Grid Services without resorting to Grid-specific protocols.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370875,Security Conscious Web Service Composition.,"A Web service is a software system designed to support interoperable application-to-application interactions over the Internet. Web services are based on a set of XML standards, such as Web Services Description Language (WSDL), Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI). Recently, there has been a growing interest in Web service composition, and some languages (e.g., WSBPEL, BPML) for modeling the composition have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on security constraints of Web service composition, which have not been deeply investigated so far. We propose a method for modeling security constraints and a brokered architecture to build composite Web services according to the specified security constraints.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370876,Service Selection in Dynamic Demand-Driven Web Services.,"Recently, Web services have become a new technologytrend for Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) andmore and more applications based on Web services areemerging. One of the problems in using Web services inbusiness applications such as logistics is servicescomposition automatically and efficiently. In this paper,we present a Dynamic, Demand-Driven Web servicesEngine called D3D-Serv to implement composite servicefunctionality that is used to dynamically build compositeservices from existing services according to differentbusiness logics and requirements. In this D3D_Servframework, the most challenging function to implement isdynamic selection of service providers at run time. Thehighly dynamic and distributed nature of Web servicesoften makes some service providers overloaded at certaintimes while others idle. To solve this problem, we proposean efficient services selection and execution strategy thatis based on the queuing theory and can provideguarantees for the QOS (Quality of Service) underprovider's limited resources. Preliminary experimentalresults have shown that this algorithm is effective.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370877,Dynamic Regeneration of Workflow Specification with Access Control Requirements in MANET.,"Distributed software systems are the basis for innovative applications. The key for achieving survivable and maintainable distributed systems is agility because the nondeterministic nature of distribution would otherwise leave the system uncontrollable, especially in emerging mobile ad-hoc networks. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is based on a self-organizing and rapidly deployed network of mobile services to collaborate without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. Survivability is defined as the capability of a service to fulfill its mission in a timely manner, even in the presence of attacks, failures, or accidents. There are four key survivability properties: resistance, recognition, recovery and adaptation. Recovery, a hallmark of survivability, is the capability to maintain critical components and resource during attack, limit the extent of damage, and restore full services following attack. Exception handling is a way to deals with the recovery aspect of survivability. Resistance can be viewed as the process of limiting access to critical and vulnerable resources only to authorized users, programs, processes, or other systems. This paper bridges the analysis of secure business process and its recovery aspect in terms of exception handling in the context of access control requirements. We propose an integrated approach to engineer a survivable distributed system through dynamic regeneration of workflow specifications in the context of Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) and eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML).",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Sinceagreeable specifications on the evaluation criteria cannot be limitedin practice, competitiveSLA management products must be extensiblein terms of their support for contract-specific SLA compliance evaluations.While the need of running and managing those software products asservices increases, we have found that developing a good solution forconfiguring them as per contractual terms is a challenging task. Thispaper presents the Fresco framework,which facilitates configuringextensible SLA management systems using Web Services. An XML- based specification of SLA management related data called SCOL willalso be presented to show how the framework supports contract- specific SLA terms and contract-specific extensions of the deployedSLA management software. The paper furthermore shows how theFresco system uses a template-based approach to communicate withother Web Services applications with support for various input and outputformats.

It allowsus to reason about feature interactions in terms ofgoal conflicts, and feature deployment. Two case studiesillustrate the approach.

However, Web services must first meet certain technical requirements including performance, security and so on. SOAP, based on Extensible Markup Language (XML), inherits not only the advantages of XML, but its relatively poor performance. This makes SOAP a poor choice for many highperformance web services. In this paper, we propose a new approach to improve Web services performance. Focusing on avoiding traditional XML parsing and Java reflection at runtime, we create a service-specific SOAP processor to accelerate execution. Through our experiments in this paper, we observed that our approach obtained about a treble performance gain (maximum) by incorporating the SOAP processor into the SOAP engine.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

It is supported by various modelling tools but so far no systems can directly execute BPMN models. The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL) on the other hand is a mainly block-structured language supported by several execution platforms. In the current setting, mapping BPMN models to BPEL code is a necessary step towards unified and standards-based business process development environments. It turns out that this mapping is challenging from a scientific viewpoint as BPMN and BPEL represent two fundamentally different classes of languages. Existing methods for mapping BPMN to BPEL impose limitations on the structure of the source model. This paper proposes a technique that overcomes these limitations. Beyond its direct relevance in the context of BPMN and BPEL, this technique addresses difficult problems that arise generally when translating between flow-based languages with parallelism.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

The focus of our work is on provenance collection for these workflows, necessary to validate the workflow and to determine quality of generated data products. The challenge we address is to record uniform and usable provenance metadata that meets the domain needs while minimizing the modification burden on the service authors and the performance overhead on the workflow engine and the services. The framework, based on a loosely-coupled publish-subscribe architecture for propagating provenance activities, satisfies the needs of detailed provenance collection while a performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performance overhead (in the range of 1% for an eight service workflow using 271 data products).",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper we will initially give anin-depth review of existing transport bindings with a strong focus ondata rate efficiency. Then we will introduce an advanced UDPbinding called PURE that significantly reduces the protocol overheadand enables interesting additional features such as point-to-multipointcommunication via IP multicast and broadcast.,2005,,,,,ICWS,,,

Web services now provide standard mechanisms to enable online interactions. Yet security, privacy and trust-related protection mechanisms for web services need additional development. In an interconnected network environment, physical connections with proper security protections are required for bridging two autonomous networks. Likewise, collaborating organizations need mechanisms for bridging extant relationships among cooperating parties that provide proper protection for privacy and trust. A trust establishment mechanism for web services must therefore ensure privacy and owner control at all times due to the subjectivity of trust relationships.

370897,Early Capacity Testing of an Enterprise Service Bus.,"An enterprise service-oriented architecture is typically realized on a messaging infrastructure called an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB). An ESB is a bus which delivers messages from service requesters to service providers. Since it sits between the service requesters and providers, it is not appropriate to use any existing capacity planning methodology for servers, such as modeling, to estimate an ESB's capacity. There are programs which run on an ESB called mediation modules. Their functionalities vary and depend on how people use the ESB. This creates difficulties for capacity planning and performance evaluation. This paper proposes a performance evaluation methodology and techniques for ESBs. We actually run the ESB on a real machine while providing a pseudo-environment around it. In order to ease setting up the environment we provide ultra-light service requestors and service providers for the ESB under test. We show that the proposed mock environment can be set up with practical hardware resources available at the time of hardware resource assessment. Our experimental results showed that the testing results with our mock environment are equivalent to the results in the real environment.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Consequently, several languages for the execution of business processes have been created. Nevertheless, as these languages cannot be used in the early stages of the development process of Web information systems (WIS), it is necessary to include methodologies that allow the systems analysts to understand the business process as well as to model the services composition. This work presents a process for the business process development based on Web Services, which starts with the identification of the services that will be offered to the user and ends with the definition of a service composition model. This process is illustrated by means of a WIS for the management of medical images that we have taken as a case study. Because it is one of the most widely used for Web services composition, we have chosen the BPEL4WS language for the implementation of the business processes. However, we have found several limitations in such language which are also described in this paper.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370906,A Framework for Intelligent Web Services: Combined HTN and CSP Approach.,"Solving general real-life problems requires a set of appropriate services to be composed via planning, scheduled, and then executed. Web service composition is the most difficult aspect and is our focus. In this paper, we describe a new framework for intelligent semantic Web services that supports the planning and scheduling aspects by a combined HTN planner and CSP. The framework covers all of the procedures needed to deal with a user's request, including domain analysis of the request, task flow decisions and CSP creation by the planner, and solving the CSP by a distributed CSP solver.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370908,Adapting Legacy Home Appliances to Home Network Systems UsingWeb Services.,"This paper presents a framework that adapts the conventional home electric appliances with the infrared remote controls (legacy appliances) to the emerging home network system (HNS). The proposed method extensively uses the concept of service-oriented architecture to improve programmable interoperability among multi-vendor appliances. We first prepare APIs that assist a PC to send infrared signals to the appliances. We then aggregate the APIs within self-contained service components, so that each of the component achieves a logical feature independent of device(or vendor)-specific operations. The service components are finally exported to the HNS as Web services. Thus, the legacy appliances can be used as distributed components with open interfaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we also implement an actual HNS and integrated services with multi-vendor legacy appliances.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper,we propose a web portal architecture that enables endusers to access the distributed application through the webinterface and to compose new tasks by integrating a set ofhigh level web services provided by portal developers. Theportal design demonstrates that flexibility, reusability andinteroperability can be provided for both end users and portaldevelopers by using semantic web services technologies.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370910,Flex-SwA: Flexible Exchange of Binary Data Based on SOAP Messages with Attachments.,"SOAP is the standard protocol for message exchange in web service environments. As an XML-based protocol, SOAP is not suitable for the transmission of large amounts of binary data. This fact has been addressed by the SOAP Messages with Attachments specification, which regulates the transfer of a SOAP message together with an arbitrary number of binary attachments composed within a MIME multipart/related message. Although this leads to a reduction of transmission overhead, web service communication using SOAP Messages with Attachments still lacks communication and processing flexibility. In this paper, we present a novel and more flexible way of handling attachments in SOAP-based web service environments. In contrast to SOAP Messages with Attachments, our approach offers message forwarding without additional communication cost and demand-driven evaluation and transmission of binary data, thus providing the opportunity to save time by overlapping service execution and data transmission.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370912,Runtime Integration of Reconfigurable Hardware in Service-Oriented Grids.,"In service-oriented Grid computing, great emphasis is placed on platform independence and cross-platform interoperability, at the price of a performance overhead incurred by the middleware and the high level programming languages typically utilized for developing software services. Reconfigurable hardware has been used in many areas of computing to improve the performance of applications by realizing performance critical parts in hardware. Typically, this is done in an application specific way, creating a custom solution for the project at hand for a specific reconfigurable hardware system. In this paper, we introduce a generic architecture in which Grid services can be dynamically transformed and run on reconfigurable hardware in a dynamic environment in which different types of reconfigurable hardware systems are present. Three approaches - static design time integration, dynamic run time integration and transparent dynamic run time integration - are presented for integrating such on-demand ""hardware services"" into a service-oriented Grid environment.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370913,Controlling Remote Instruments Using Web Services for Online Experiment Systems.,Online experimentation allows students from anywhere to operate remote instruments at any time. This promising e-learning application is well positioned to use Web Services to conduct online experiment systems due to its interoperability and Internet compliance. We present a double client-server architecture for online experiment systems and the methodology to wrap the functions of instruments into Web Services. We propose that the instrument Web Services should be stateful services and we present the framework to manage the states of the instrument web services. We benchmark the performance of this system when using SOAP as the wire format for communication and propose solutions to optimize performance.,2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370914,A Service-oriented Middleware for Runtime Web Services Interoperability.,"A major goal of service-oriented architectures is to enable software interoperability in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. Web services standards and protocols aim to support this goal and middleware systems implementing these standards and protocols consequently are needed. Maintenance and administration of middleware is made difficult due to variations in standards and their constant evolution. In this paper, we introduce a new service-oriented middleware architecture for runtime Web services interoperability. Different from other middleware systems our approach applies service-oriented computing principles on the middleware layer, thereby establishing an on-demand model for middleware features. Clients can use middleware as services, dynamically discovering and using the services as interoperability requirements are determined. Further, middleware as services allows middleware to be provided and managed separately from its clients. We present the policy-based programming model, architecture, and details of our middleware, and discuss new challenges that arise in this context, such as distribution of middleware services. The approach is validated through a scenario integrating web service transaction middleware.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370915,Main Business Service Dimensions In an E-commerce Environment.,"Improving service quality has long been recognized as a keybusiness strategy in consumer market. However, little is writtenin the literature about service among business organizations. Theshortage of knowledge on business service (BS) poses a significant challenge in tracking and improving BS quality in todayÃ_s e-commerceenvironment. To address this, this paper takes a first step to identifymain BS dimensions in an e-commerce environment. It first providesa review on BS. Then the BS gap model and main BS dimension areidentified. The paper concludes with a summary and future researchsuggestions.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370916,Fortified Web Services Contracts for Trusted Components.,"Web services provide a standard means of interoperating between different software applications, running on a variety of platforms and/or frameworks. While the concepts of Web services are aimed at providing a standard means to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network, they do not solve the problem of trust between service requesters and providers. A Trusted Component is defined as a reusable software element possessing specified and guaranteed property qualities. The highly reusable nature of a Web service emphasizes the need for a ""trust ensuring"" mechanism between the requester and the provider of the service.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370918,Implementing a Flexible Compensation Mechanism for Business Processes in Web Service Environment.,"Web services have been emerging as a promising technology for business process integrations. Due to their long-duration and loosely coupled properties, Web service based applications require transactional support beyond traditional transactions. Some web service standards have been proposed to deal with the transaction aspect of Web service applications. Compensation is a commonly used mechanism in these standards for backward recovery. However, the compensation mechanism usually adopted is too fixed and cannot satisfy the various requirements of different applications. In this paper, we first analyse the compensation protocol of current standards. Then we enrich the protocol by allowing flexible compensation and extend our proposed multiple-compensation mechanism in web service environment. The implementation of the extended compensation mechanism is discussed and the incorporation of the mechanism into current standards is also addressed.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370919,A Middleware for Replicated Web Services.,This paper presents a middleware that supports reliable web services built on active replication. The middleware is responsible for maintaining the consistency of the replicasÃ_ states. A Java package for handling the interactions with the middleware and the failures of the web services is provided for programmers to use when writing client applications. The package reduces the complexity in developing client applications.,2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370920,Adaptation inWeb Service Composition and Execution.,"Web services simplify enterprise application integration by facilitating reuse of existing components for creating new services. In a dynamic environment, it is imperative to design a Web Service Composition and Execution (WSCE) system that adapts to failure of component services or changes in their QoS offerings. In this paper, we motivate a staged approach for adaptive WSCE (A-WSCE) that cleanly separates the functional and non-functional requirements of a new service, and enables different environmental changes to be absorbed at different stages of composition and execution. We use Synthy, a prototype service creation environment, to implement our solution and demonstrate its effectiveness.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370921,Privacy Policy Compliance for Web Services.,"The growth of the Internet has been accompanied bythe growth of web services (e.g. e-commerce, e-health).This proliferation of web services and theincreasing regulatory and legal requirements forpersonal privacy have fueled the need to protect thepersonal privacy of web service users. We advocate aprivacy policy negotiation approach to protectingpersonal privacy [Bilateral E-services Negotiation Under Uncertainty, The Negotiation of Privacy Policies in Distance Education]. We provided semi-automatedapproaches for deriving personal privacy policies in[Semi-Automated Derivation of Personal Privacy Policies]. However, it is evident that approaches are also needed to ensure that providers of web servicescomply with the privacy policies of service users. Inthis paper, we examine privacy legislation to deriverequirements for privacy policy compliance systems.We then propose an architecture for a privacy policycompliance system that satisfies the requirements anddiscuss the strengths and weaknesses of our proposedarchitecture.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370922,An Approach for Specifying Capability ofWeb Services based on Environment Ontology.,"Capability specification is key problem for Web service discovery. Conventional one-step process based capability specification has its limitations. This paper proposes an approach for semantic behavior-based capability specification of Web service to stride over the limitations. Meta-level environment ontology is proposed to provide formal and sharable specifications of environment resources in a particular domain. For each environment resource, there is a corresponding hierarchical state machine specifying its dynamic characteristics. Then, effects on the environment resources are modelled with the hierarchical state machines. On the basis of the environment ontology, forest-structured communicating hierarchical state machines (FCHM) are defined and expected to be semantics of capability specification of Web services, which can be derived from the effects that Web services impose on their environments.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370923,Negotiated Security Policies for E-Services and Web Services.,"The growth of the Internet has been accompanied by the growthof e-services (e.g. e-commerce, ehealth). This proliferation of e- services and the increasing attacks on them by malicious individuals have highlighted the need for e-service security. The securityrequirements of an e-service may be specified in an e-servicesecurity policy. The provider of the eservice is then responsiblefor implementing the security measures contained in the policy.However, a service consumer may have security preferences that are not reflected in the providerÃ_s e-service security policy (e.g.defense contractors may require higher levels of security). In orderfor service providers to reach a wider market, a way of customizinga security policy to a particular consumer is needed. We derive the content of an e-service security policy and propose a flexibleapproach that will allow an e-service provider and consumer tonegotiate to an agreed-upon e-service security policy. In addition,we examine how our approach may be implemented in a WebServices environment and briefly describe the design of our security policy negotiation prototype.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370924,A Framework for Building Privacy-Conscious Composite Web Services.,"The rapid growth of web applications has prompted increasing interest in the area of composite web services that involve several service providers. The potential for such composite web services can be realized only if consumer privacy concerns are satisfactorily addressed. In this paper, we propose a framework that addresses consumer privacy concerns in the context of highly customizable composite web services. Our approach involves service producers exchanging their terms-of-use with consumers in the form of ""models"". Our framework provides automated techniques for checking these models at the consumer site for compliance of consumer privacy policies. In the event of a policy violation, our framework supports automatic generation of ""obligations"" that the consumer generates for the composite service. These obligations are automatically enforced through a dynamic program analysis approach on the web service composition code. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of two example services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370925,A CP-nets-based Design and Verification Framework for Web Services Composition.,"Web services aim to support efficient integration ofapplications over Web. Most Web services are stateful,such as services for business processes, and theyconverse with each other via properly orderedinteractions, instead of individual unrelatedinvocations. In order to address efficient integration ofconversational Web services, we create a unifiedspecification model for both conversation protocol andcomposition; we propose methods to integrate apartner service with complex conversation protocolinto a composition of Web services; assure thecorrectness of composition by formal verification. Themapping between our model and BPEL4WS is alsodiscussed.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

WS-Net describes each webservices component in three layers: interface net declaresthe services that the component provides to othercomponents; interconnection net specifies the servicesthat the component acquires to accomplish its mission;and interoperation net describes the internal operationalbehaviors of the component. As an architectural modelthat formalizes the architectural topology and behaviorsof each web services component as well as the entiresystem, WS-Net facilitates the verification and monitoringof web services integration.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

Especially, UDDI isthe Web Services Registry enabling to register andsearch Web Services, that takes charge of providinginfrastructure for Web Services.

This calls for a rapid reaction to the market trends, a rapid handling of user needs, and a rapid understanding of forthcoming challenges. To support businesses in the process of reaching these goals, Web services need to be selfaware of the environment in which they operate and self-healing so they can recover to normal levels of operation after disturbances.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370935,An Architecture for Personal Semantic Web Information Retrieval System--Integrating Web Services and Web Contents.,"The semantic Web and Web services technologies have providedboth new possibilities and challenges to automatic informationprocessing. There are a lot of researches on applying these newtechnologies to current personal Web information retrieval systems,but no research addresses the semantic issues from the whole lifecycle and architecture point of view. Web services provide a new wayfor accessing Web resources, but until now, they have been managedseparately from conventional Web contents resources. In this paper, we point out new system requirements and propose aconceptual architecture for a personal semantic Web informationretrieval system. It incorporates semantic Web, Web services andmulti-agent technologies to enable not only precise location of Webresources but also the automatic or semi-automatic integration of hybridWeb contents and Web service resources.",2005,,,,,ICWS,,,
370936,Web Services versus Distributed Objects: A Case Study of Performance and Interface Design.,"Web services are promoted as a new model for distributed systems, yet many skeptics see them as simply a poor implementation of traditional remote procedure calls (RPC) or distributed objects. Previous comparisons support the skeptics: web services are shown to be significantly slower than RPC, and they lack features like automatic proxies. However, these studies are biased because they are based on an RPC communication style. Web services support a document-oriented style of communication that performs well even in the face of the high latency found in internet or business transactions. We investigate these issues by comparing the design and implementation of a small file server application implemented using RMI and web services. For this application, using the most straightforward implementation in both technologies, web services outperform RMI when accessing multiple/deeply nested files, especially over highlatency channels. However, the default web services interfaces are awkward to use, so we develop a technique for wrapping the web service to make it as easy to use as the distributed object implementation. The same wrappers are then used to implement the document-oriented communication style in RMI, which improves performance but significantly complicates the design. This case study provides a more detailed comparison of the relationship between web services and distributed objects.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370937,A Polyarchical Middleware for Self-Regenerative Invocation of Multi-Standard Ubiquitous Services.,"Whilst the vision of a robust Service-OrientedArchitecture (SOA) is very seductive it engenders manytechnical challenges. The main challenge is thedevelopment and support of runtime cross-standardservice activation and interoperation. Suchinteroperation will provide a vital stepping-stonetowards the integration of the emerging SOA standardsand legacy services - those developed using existingmiddleware architectures such as DCOM, COBRA,J2EE, Web service, JXTA, and Jini. Much relatedworks already exist including WSIF framework, whichprovides APIs to support design-time invocation ofcross-standard Web services deployed on multipleSOAP packages. However, this paper focuses on aruntime self-regenerative mechanism related toadaptive service invocation code. The paper willpresent a runtime service adaptation mechanism,which supports end-users to dynamically adapt tovariations in the execution environment, withoutaltering their original design, crossing multiplestandards (both synchronous and asynchronousinvocation models) and middleware architectures. Thispaper also introduces a proposed ""PolyarchicalMiddleware"" architecture to support such self-regenerativeservice adaptation. An illustrative example will be used to describe the approach and thecurrent implementation. The paper will conclude withgeneral remarks and mention of further work.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,
370938,WSCE: A Flexible Web Service Composition Environment.,"In this paper, we propose the concepts of virtualpartner and inspector into the web servicescomposition. Virtual partner, as an IT level concept, isa web service (pseudo web service) using the sameinterface with the actual partner but different bindingmessage. A virtual partner can be invoked directly by abusiness process described by BPEL, so that the BPELprogrammer can test both application's functionalityand non functionality performance early in thedevelopment cycle to avoid any problems in the finalruntime, or test the selection of their partners inbusiness level design. The IT virtual partners providedevelopers with a range of the techniques which letthem explore every aspect of their program. Inspectoris proposed when using the third -party process engine.An inspector itself is also a web service. Theprogrammer can register any required outputinformation in it. The IT virtual partner and theinspector concepts have been integrated in our WSCE,a flexible Web Services Composition Environment for abusiness process. WSCE is a prototype of autonomicmodeling and simulation environment. With the help ofa third-party BPEL engine, it provides programmerwith concepts and tools to facilitate business process programming.",2004,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper, we present a serviceoriented business process optimization model that minimizes potential revenue leakage through process improvements. We introduce service componentization approach to decompose business processes to identify re-usable services in SOA solution context.

The proposed approach can help streamline the dispute management process with revenue increase and higher customer satisfaction.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370952,A Table-Driven Streaming XML Parsing Methodology for High-Performance Web Services.,"This paper presents a table-driven streaming XML parsing methodology, called TDX. TDX expedites XML parsing by pre-recording the states of an XML parser in tabular form and by utilizing an efficient runtime streaming parsing engine based on a push-down automaton. The parsing tables are automatically produced from the XML schemas of a WSDL service description. Because the schema constraints are pre-encoded in a parsing table, the approach effectively implements a schema-specific XML parsing technique that combines parsing and validation into a single pass. This significantly increases the performance of XML Web services, which results in better response time and may reduce the impact of the flash-crowd effect. To implement TDX, we developed a parser construction toolkit to automatically construct parsers in C code from WSDLs and XML schemas. We applied the toolkit to an example Web services application and measured the raw performance compared to popular high-performance parsers written in C/C++, such as eXpat, gSOAP, and Xerces. The performance results show that TDX can be an order of magnitude faster.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370953,A Service-Oriented Trust Management Model on Application Server.,"In the service-oriented architecture, the components deployed on application servers are published as web services. Though many researches focus on how to authorize at the web service level currently, there is little work involving the authorization gap between the service and its component implementation. This paper tries to bridge the gap by proposing a service-oriented trust management model, which expands the application server's capability to deal with more complex trust relationship between service users and services, and supplies a flexible trust management mechanism to integrate authentication and authorization together. Moreover, the model provides a finer granularity access control, sustains delegation between users, and has a certain extent reasoning capability. The model has been implemented in a J2EE application server, and the experiment has demonstrated that the model has high flexibility and scalability.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

The standards based approach utilized by Web services has supported interoperability at the syntax level. However, issues of structural and semantic heterogeneity between messages exchanged by Web services are far more complex and crucial to interoperability. It is for these reasons that we recognize the value that schema/data mappings bring to Web service descriptions. In this paper, we examine challenges to interoperability; classify the types of heterogeneities that can occur between interacting services and present a possible solution for data mediation using the mapping support provided by WSDL-S, the extensibility features of WSDL and the popular SOAP engine, Axis 2.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370959,Optimal Adaptation in Web Processes with Coordination Constraints.,"We present methods for optimally adapting Web processes to exogenous events while preserving inter-service constraints that necessitate coordination. For example, in a supply chain process, orders placed by a manufacturer may get delayed in arriving. In response to this event, the manufacturer has the choice of either waiting out the delay or changing the supplier. Additionally, there may be compatibility constraints between the different orders, thereby introducing the problem of coordination between them if the manufacturer chooses to change the suppliers. We focus on formulating the decision making models of the managers, who must adapt to external events while satisfying the coordination constraints, using Markov decision processes. Our methods range from being centralized and globally optimal in their adaptation but not scalable, to decentralized that is suboptimal but scalable to multiple managers. We also develop a hybrid approach that improves on the performance of the decentralized approach with a minimal loss of optimality.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Therefore, the coordinator process is complex, less scalable, and bulky. This paper introduces an architecture and a technique for distributing the centralized coordination logic of traditional workflows by (i) extending the stateless web services into self-coordinating entities using coordinator proxy objects, and (ii) creating a workflow over these entities by interconnecting them into a distributed network of objects using web bond primitives. Previously, we have developed web bond primitives to enforce interdependencies among autonomous entities. We have designed and prototyped our BondFlow system, which provides a platform to configure such distributed workflows, producing coordination components with footprint small enough (around 150 KB) to be executed on a handheld.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370963,Composing Business Processes with Partial Observable Problem Space in Web Services Environments.,"Composing business processes from individual services can be viewed as a planning problem in which a planner determines the execution orders of services in a process. Most existing Web Service composition research considers connecting Web Services into a business process. We argue that most existing Web Services are informative Web Services that are not the actual business services, but give the parameters of their correspondent business services. The planning problem is not only to select the proper business services, but also to determine the parameters of the business services which affect the ordering of the business services. Furthermore, it is not possible to extract all information from informative Web Services through queries. The planner has to work with the problem space that is not fully enumerable. This paper presents a method to optimize planning results with incompletely observed problem space. Genetic Algorithms (GA) help to navigate the incompletely observed problem space. At each loop of GA, Web Service data are queried and a new sub problem space is built. The planner works with the sub problem space and calculates all feasible plans. The plans are evaluated by GA in fitness function and the best plans are kept for the next loop of GA. The fitness function of GA reflects domain-dependent user preferences. The selected final plan is an optimized feasible plan though global optimization is not guaranteed.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370966,A Mixed Initiative Approach to Semantic Web Service Discovery and Composition: SAP's Guided Procedures Framework.,"A central element of emerging Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) is the ability to develop new applications by composing enterprise functionality encapsulated in the form of services - whether within a given organization or across multiple ones. Semantic service annotations, including annotations of both functional and non-functional attributes, offer the prospect of facilitating this process and of producing higher quality solutions. A significant body of work in this area has aimed to fully automate this process, while assuming that all services already have rich and accurate annotations, In this article, we argue that this assumption is often unrealistic. Instead, we describe a mixed initiative framework for semantic web service discovery and composition that aims at flexibly interleaving human decision making and automated functionality in environments where annotations may be incomplete and even inconsistent. An initial version of this framework has been implemented in SAP's Guided Procedures, a key element of SAP's Enterperise Service Architecture (ESA).",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370982,Developing a Selection Model for Interactive Web Services.,"Traditional web services are function oriented, where various developed standards mainly assist business applications to expose their functional descriptions, but each service consumer is required to develop different presentation logics for the same business logic respectively. Although works on the Interactive Web Service (IWS) make some progress and achieve the result of WSRP, researchers keep on making efforts to encapsulate user interface with the functional interface so as to present available information of content and facilitate the direct interactions between users and back-end services. Regarding IWS this paradigm of web services, service selection will shift focus from function orientation to presentation orientation. This paper proposes a novel IWS description model with the extension of an element -View and its three sub-elements including presentation, content and interaction, with which IWS can be described more completely and accurately. Based on the description model, an IWS selection model with matching rules is developed, which can meet diverse selection requirements of service consumers at multiple levels and aspects.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
370983,DSCWeaver: Synchronization-Constraint Aspect Extension to Procedural Process Specification Languages.,"BPEL is emerging as an open-standards language for Web service composition. However, its procedural style can lead to inflexible and tangled code for managing a crosscutting aspect Â— synchronization constraints that define permissible sequences of execution for activities in a process. In this paper, we present DSCWeaver, a tool that enables a synchronization-aspect extension to BPEL. It uses DSCL, a synchronization expression language, to specify constraints. DSCL has the desirable features of declarative syntax, fine granularity, and validation support. A designer can use DSCL to describe and validate the synchronization behavior and rely on DSCWeaver to generate BPEL code. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach in a service deployment process and evaluate its performance using two metrics: Lines of Code (LoC) and Places to Visit (PtV). Evaluation results show that our approach can effectively reduce development effort of process designers while providing performance competitive to un-woven BPEL code.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

370985,Trust-based Resource Allocation in Web Services.,"With the number of e-Business applications dramatically increasing, service level agreement (SLA) will play an important part in Web services. A SLA is a combination of several quality of services (QoS), such as security, performance, and availability, agreed between a customer and a service provider. Most existing research addresses only one QoS metric, and in the case of the response time, the average time to process and complete a job is typically used. In this paper, we study trustworthiness, percentile response time and availability. We consider all these qualities for a trust-based resource allocation problem which typically arises in Web services applications. We formulate the trust-based resource allocation problem as an optimization problem under SLA constraints, and we solve it using an efficient numerical procedure.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

However, most of the XML-based applications, particularly the emerging web services, suffer from low performance caused by XML processing and thus bring negative user experience in terms of response time. We argue that by reducing the considerable overhead in garbage collection the XML processing performance can be improved. We begin by conducting a set of experiments to understand the XML parser's memory characteristics, such as heap composition, object size and type distributions, object lifetime, and so on. Then, we get the valuable findings for improving performance that XML processing, which violates the weak generational hypothesis, is an memory allocation intensive workload in which most objects are small and long-lived. The findings can benefit the design of XML parsing specific GC and related tools designed to improve XML processing performance for web services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

371019,Lightweight Checkpointing for Faster SOAP Deserialization.,"Differential Deserialization (DDS) is an optimization technique that exploits similarities between incoming SOAP messages to reduce deserialization time. DDS works by checkpointing the state of the SOAP deserializer at various points while deserializing a message, and using those checkpoints to avoid full deserialization of similar messages. DDS can improve performance in many cases, but its benefit is limited by the potentially significant memory and processing overhead associated with its checkpointing mechanism. Differential checkpointing (DCP) substantially reduces memory use, but still requires significant processing overhead. In this paper, we introduce lightweight checkpointing (LCP), a checkpointing approach that significantly reduces the cost of both DDS and DCP, in terms of both memory use and processing time. LCP statically determines locations in the incoming message where it would be most efficient to create checkpoints. LCP creates checkpoints much faster than both our original DDS checkpointing mechanism and our DCP approach. LCP also has significantly smaller memory requirements. For example, in some of our test cases, LCP requires only 10% of the memory that DCP requires, and only 3% of the memory that our original approach required. In terms of processing time, deserialization with LCP is approximately 50% to 60% faster than without differential deserialization, when approximately half the message is unchanged from the previous message.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371020,Automatic Matchmaking of Web Services.,"Web services help in achieving increased automation across organizational boundaries. In this paper, we present an approach for annotating WSDL documents with semantically rich descriptions. We also present an algorithm that considers such annotations in addition to just the types of input and output parameters. Our matchmaking algorithm not only returns match/no-match answers but in case of a match a set of conditions under which a web service offers the desired functionality.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371021,SEMAPLAN: Combining Planning with Semantic Matching to Achieve Web Service Composition.,"In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to compose Web services in the presence of semantic ambiguity by combining semantic matching and AI planning algorithms. We use cues from domain-independent and domain-specific ontologies to compute an overall semantic similarity score between ambiguous terms. This semantic similarity score is used by AI planning algorithms to guide the searching process when composing services. Experimental results indicate that planning with semantic matching produces better results than planning or semantic matching alone. The solution is suitable for semi-automated composition tools or directory browsers.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371022,Exploring Perturbation Based Testing for Web Services.,"Web Service is a modern technology commonly used to integrate software projects among different platforms, operating systems or even programming languages. This distributed and heterogeneous nature complicates the testing activity which is, in general, expensive and effort demanding. Adequate and cost effective testing methods are needed for Web Services. An extended approach based on XML messages perturbation has been introduced to test pairs of Web Services. Perturbation operators produce modified XML messages, which are used as test cases. This work explores the use of such promising approach by introducing new perturbation operators for SOAP messages and describing a supporting tool, named SMAT-WS. An experimental study was accomplished with this tool. The obtained results allow an evaluation of the perturbation operators regarding cost and efficacy.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371023,A Cooperative and Adaptive System for Caching Web Service Responses in MANETs.,"This paper proposes a new model for caching Web service response data in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). The aim is to enable any node joining the Ad Hoc network to either contribute services to other nodes or to consume services offered by other nodes. This model attempts to coordinate the service discovery and service use processes while maintaining minimal communication among nodes. The system comprises Proxy Caches (PCs), for acting as the interface to remote Web services and the internally cached service responses, Request Directories (RDs) for caching the cache keys that act as indexes to the responses, and finally, the Caching Nodes (CNs) that cache the responses. The CNs are the mobile nodes that requested the cached responses while the RDs are the ones that store the cache keys generated from the submitted requests and hold pointers to the CNs that store the responses. The PCs, RDs, and CNs are added (assigned) based on need according to capability criteria. Experimental results show the superiority of the system over non-caching and illustrate its performance in terms of delay and load versus hit ratio, which is a function of the system's caching capacity.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371024,A Lightweight Framework forWeb Services Invocation over Bluetooth.,"We present an experiment relative to the use of Bluetooth wireless technology to provide network support for midlet applications accessing Web Services. We refer to the most common architecture used to invoke Web Services, where a client and a server exchange SOAP messages using HTTP as the transport protocol. To the best of our knowledge, there is no implemented support for executing a HTTP POST operation over a Bluetooth channel. Therefore, to guarantee the independence of the application from the type of communication channel used, in this paper, we deal with the problem of designing a framework allowing a Java application programmer to directly interface Web Services from a mobile device using a Bluetooth connection. This paper presents a proof of concept of how Bluetooth technology can be used to design, develop, and deploy Web Services-based applications. According to our experiments, programming interfaces like Blue Cove and kSOAP, despite being still under development, are mature enough to be used as the underlying technologies for Web Services invocation over Bluetooth in a real world application.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371025,Process Mining Discovery and Integration using Distance Measures.,"Business processes continue to play an important role in today's service-oriented enterprise computing systems. Mining, discovering, and integrating processoriented services has attracted growing attention in the recent year. In this paper we present a quantitative approach to modeling and capturing the similarity and dissimilarity between different process designs. We derive the similarity measures by analyzing the process dependency graphs of the participating workflow processes. We first convert each process dependency graph into a normalized process matrix. Then we calculate the metric space distance between the normalized matrices. This distance measure can be used as a quantitative and qualitative tool in process mining, process merging, and process clustering, and ultimately it can reduce or minimize the costs involved in design, analysis, and evolution of workflow systems.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

371027,A Quality- and Cost-based Selection Model for Multimedia Service Composition in Mobile Environments.,"When moving from monolithic applications towards service-oriented multimedia frameworks, the composition of Web services to form complex multimedia workflows becomes a demanding problem. Especially mobile devices require a flexible composition strategy as they often have to move computationally complex or power-demanding tasks to powerful servers. Such a strategy also has to consider the changing environment due to movements of the device and it has to adapt to device-specific characteristics, e.g., the current battery level. Hence, mobile devices experience problems beyond the mere question of services' availability or successful execution. We propose the E2Mon algorithm that monitors the execution chain of Web services and gracefully recovers from failures of individual services and network-specific or device-specific alarms. The sophisticated control flow dynamically chooses the quality-optimal and cost-optimal composition of available services handling both successive and parallel service execution.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371028,Run-Time Monitoring of Instances and Classes of Web Service Compositions.,"The run-time monitoring of web service compositions has been widely acknowledged as a significant and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the problem of monitoring web services implemented in BPEL. We devise an architecture that clearly separates the business logic of a web service from its monitoring functionality. The architecture supports both ""instance monitors"" that deal with the execution of a single instance of BPEL process, as well as ""class monitors"" that report aggregated information about all the instances of a BPEL process. We also define a language for the specification of instance and class monitors. The language allows for specifying boolean, statistic, and time-related properties. Finally, we devise a technique for the automatic translation of all these kinds of monitors to Java programs.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371029,Model Driven Design of Distribution Patterns forWeb Service Compositions.,"Increasingly, distributed systems are being constructed by composing a number of discrete components. This practice, termed composition, is particularly prevalent within the Web service domain. Here, enterprise systems are built from many existing discrete applications, often legacy applications exposed using Web service interfaces. There are a number of architectural configurations or distribution patterns, which express how a composed system is to be deployed. However, the amount of code required to realise these distribution patterns is considerable. In this paper, we propose a novel Model Driven Architecture using UML 2.0, which takes existing Web service interfaces as its input and generates an executable Web service composition, based on a distribution pattern chosen by the software architect.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371030,ComposingWeb Services with Nondeterministic Behavior.,"The promise of Web services is to enable the composition of new distributed applications/solutions: when no available service can satisfy a client request, (parts of) available services can be composed and orchestrated in order to satisfy such a request. Service composition involves two different issues: the synthesis, in order to synthesize, either manually or automatically, a specification of how coordinating the component services to fulfill the client request, and the orchestration, i.e., how executing the previous obtained specification by suitably supervising and monitoring both the control flow and the data flow among the involved services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371031,Heuristics for QoS-aware Web Service Composition.,"This paper discusses the Quality of Service (QoS)- aware composition of Web Services. The work is based on the assumption that for each task in a workflow a set of alternative Web Services with similar functionality is available and that these Web Services have different QoS parameters and costs. This leads to the general optimization problem of how to select Web Services for each task so that the overall QoS and cost requirements of the composition are satisfied. Current proposals use exact algorithms or complex heuristics (e.g. genetic algorithms) to solve this problem. An actual implementation of a workflow engine (like our WSQoSX architecture), however, has to be able to solve these optimization problems in real-time and under heavy load. Therefore, we present a heuristic that performs extremely well while providing excellent (almost optimal) solutions. Using simulations, we show that in most cases our heuristic is able to calculate solutions that come as close as 99% to the optimal solution while taking less than 2% of the time of a standard exact algorithm. Further, we also investigate how much and under which circumstances the solution obtained by our heuristic can be further improved by other heuristics.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371032,Access Control and Authorization Constraints for WS-BPEL.,"Computerized workflow systems have attracted considerable research interest in the last fifteen years. More recently, there have been several XML-based languages proposed for specifying and orchestrating business processes, culminating in WS-BPEL. A significant omission from WSBPEL is the ability to specify authorization information associating users with activities in the business process and authorization constraints on the execution of activities such as separation of duty. In this paper, we address these deficiencies by developing the RBAC-WS-BPEL and BPCL languages. The first of these provides for the specification of authorization information associated with a business process specified in WS-BPEL, while BPCL provides for the articulation of authorization constraints.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371033,Discovering and Improving Recovery Mechanisms of CompositeWeb Services.,"One of the main challenges that encounter Web services is how to ensure reliable compositions. In this paper we present an approach that starts from a composite service effective executions to improve its reliability. Basically, we propose a set of mining techniques to discover its model and its transactional behavior from an event based log. Then, based on this mining step, we use a set of rules to improve its recovery mechanisms.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371034,A Lightweight Software Design Process for Web Services Workflows.,"Service-oriented computing (SOC) suggests that many open, network-accessible services will be available over the Internet for organizations to incorporate into their own processes. Developing new software systems by composing an organization's local services and externally-available web services is conceptually different from system development supported by traditional software engineering lifecycles. Consumer organizations typically have no control over the quality and/or consistency of the external services that they incorporate, thus top-down software development lifecycles are impractical. Software architects and designers will require agile, lightweight processes to evaluate tradeoffs in system design based on the ""estimated"" responsiveness of external services coupled with known performance of local services. We introduce a model-driven software engineering approach for designing systems (i.e. workflows of web services) under these circumstances and a corresponding simulation-based evaluation tool.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371035,Reliable Messaging for BPEL Processes.,"There are currently two specifications that address reliable messaging in Web Services: WS-ReliableMessaging and WS-Reliability. Both specifications consider the general case of Web Services as being black boxes with WSDL interfaces. In this paper, we address the reliable messaging requirements of Composite Web Services in BPEL. In such Web Services, the BPEL programmer sees not only the WSDL interface but also the implementation, i.e., the process definition. BPEL processes have several reliable messaging requirements, which cannot be supported by current reliable messaging specifications. The most challenging of those requirements is to support ordered message delivery between many endpoints. Current reliable messaging specifications support only reliable messaging between two endpoints. This paper presents several approaches to support multi-party reliable messaging and introduces a reliable messaging Web Service for BPEL that is integrated with a BPEL engine by using a process container framework. This Web Service supports the reliable messaging requirements of BPEL processes and its implementation is based on Sandesha, which is an open source implementation of WS-ReliableMessaging.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371036,Strategic Web-Service Agreements.,"This paper addresses issues of strategy in Webservice composition, and inter-site collaboration in general. The results are useful for both human and artificial agents of a site who are responsible for determining Web-service agreements that are most profitable for that site. We discuss three specific questions in this area. (1) How should the profit resulting from a composition of Web-services be divided among the participants? (2) How can we counter the risk of serviceproviders misrepresenting their services in an attempt to gain a larger share of the profit? (3) Are stable configurations guaranteed or feasible when each service-provider's decisions on how to collaborate (permit compositions) are guided solely by the goal of maximizing its profit?",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

This work is important because it determines the accuracy of task execution and the feasibility of content reuse in the network.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371038,An SOA-based Framework for Instrument Management for Large-scale Observing Systems (USArray Case Study).,"Large-scale observing systems are poised to become the dominant means of study for a variety of natural phenomena. These systems are comprised of hundreds to thousands of instruments that must be queried, managed, and shared in a scalable fashion. Services-oriented architectures (SOAs) are widely recognized as the preferred framework for building scalable and extensible cyberinfrastructure. By applying SOA concepts, we created a framework for organizing observing system resources. Guided by this framework, we developed web services, custom workflow applications, and an integrated user interface of monitors and controls for managing instruments in large-scale sensor network observing systems. In this paper we present our approach and discuss its application to the NSF EarthScope USArray large-scale seismic observing system.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371039,A Model-driven WSDL Extension for Describing the QoS ofWeb Services.,"Web services are the building blocks of the emerging computing paradigm based on service-oriented architectures. A web service is a self-describing, open component that supports rapid composition of distributed applications. Web service definitions are used to describe the service capabilities in terms of the operations of the service and the input and output messages for each operation. Such definitions are expressed in XML by use of the Web Service Definition Language (WSDL). Unfortunately, a WSDL description only addresses the functional aspects of a web service without containing any useful description of non-functional or quality of service (QoS) characteristics. This paper introduces a lightweight WSDL extension for the description of QoS characteristics of a web service. The extension is carried out as a metamodel transformation, according to principles and standards recommended by the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The WSDL metamodel is introduced and then transformed into the Q-WSDL (QoS-enabled WSDL) metamodel. The proposed Q-WSDL extension can effectively be used to specify QoS requirements, to establish service level agreements (SLA), to add QoS-oriented characteristics when querying registries of web services and to support the automated mapping from WSDL documents to Q-WSDL ones and from UML models to Q-WSDL web services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371040,Inferring Validating and Coordinating the Commitments in aWorkflow.,"A workflow can be represented as a set of Web services and a specification for the control and data flows among these services. It can also be represented as a colored Petri net (CPN), which is a graphical and mathematical modeling tool. In multiagent systems (MAS), a workflow is a dynamic set of tasks performed by a set of agents to reach a shared goal. We show herein that commitments among agents can be used to model a workflow and coordinate their execution of it. This paper presents methodologies to map an OWL-S model for a workflow to a CPN, and then to infer commitments and causal relationships from the CPN graph. With our methodologies, agents can collaboratively enact a workflow through commitment-based formalisms.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Within the Global Grid Forum, HP, NEC, and Softricity have been developing a standard for Configuration Description, Deployment, and Lifecycle Management (CDDLM). In order to prove its feasibility, reference implementations are being developed. This paper describes an independent reference implementation of CDDLM and the experience in using Web Services for deployment in a standardized manner. Our main contributions are: the lessons learned in implementing this WS-based standard and an architecture for implementing CDDLM.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371042,A Semantic Web Services Approach Towards Automated Software Engineering.,"The growing complexity of software, combined with demands for greater productivity and shorter cycles, creates an increasing demand for more automation and integration within the software engineering (SE) domain. When viewed holistically, the heterogeneous nature, implicit feature cross-dependencies, and manual administration of the toolchain infrastructure results in unnecessary complexity, inefficiencies, and reduced reliability for the SE process. A common infrastructure is missing that provides an interoperable and distributed tool environment, addresses feature dependency selection, and automates toolchain workflow composition and execution. To address these challenges, this paper explores the practicality of a unifying Semantic Web Services approach towards Automated Software Engineering (SWS-ASE).",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371043,Exploring Remote Object Coherence in XMLWeb Services.,"Object-level coherence in distributed applications and systems has been studied extensively. Object coherence in platform-specific and tightly-coupled systems is achieved with binary serialization protocols to ensure data structures and object graphs are safely transmitted, manipulated, and stored. On the opposite side of the spectrum are platform-neutral Web services that embrace XML as a serialization protocol for building loosely coupled systems. The advantages of XML to connect heterogeneous systems are plenty, but rendering programming-language specific data structures and object graphs in text form incurs a performance hit and presents challenges for systems that require object coherence. Achieving the latter goal poses difficulties by a phenomenon that is sometimes referred to as the ""impedance mismatch"" between programming language data types and XML schema types. This paper examines the problem, debunks the O/X-mismatch controversy, and presents a mix of static/dynamic algorithms for accurate XML serialization. Experimental results show that the implementation in C/C++ is efficient and competitive to binary protocols. Application of the approach to other programming languages, such as Java, is also discussed.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371044,Recovery Policies for Enhancing Web Services Reliability.,"Web services are gaining acceptance as a standards-based approach for integrating loosely coupled services often distributed over a network. Hence, achieving high levels of reliability and availability in spite of service or infrastructure failures poses unique set of challenges. However, current Web services middleware provide limited constructs for specifying faults detection and recovery actions. Additionally, faults-handling logic often gets scattered and tangled with the service logic. Consequently, this negatively impacts maintainability and adaptability. To address these requirements for reliable and fault tolerant Web services execution, we propose a set extensible recovery policies to declaratively specify how to handle and recover from typical faults in Web services composition. The identified constructs were incorporated into a lightweight service management middleware named MASC (Manageable and Adaptive Service Composition) to transparently enact the fault management policies and facilitate the monitoring, configuration and control of managed services. Several experimental results with a service based supply chain management system illustrate the effectiveness of our approach to providing reliable and uninterrupted services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371045,Workflow discovery: the problem a case study from e-Science and a graph-based solution.,"Much has been written on the promise of Web service discovery and (semi-) automated composition. In this discussion, the value to practitioners of discovering and reusing existing service compositions, captured in workflows, is mostly ignored. This paper presents one solution to workflow discovery. Through a survey with 21 scientists and developers from the myGrid workflow environment, workflow discovery requirements are elicited. Through a user experiment with 13 scientists, an attempt is made to build a gold standard for workflow ranking. Through the design and implementation of a workflow discovery tool, a mechanism for ranking workflow fragments is provided based on graph sub-isomorphism matching. The tool evaluation, drawing on a corpus of 89 public workflows from bioinformatics and the results of the user experiment, finds that the average human ranking can largely be reproduced.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371046,Behavioral matchmaking for service retrieval.,"The capability to easily find useful services (software applications, software components, scientific computations) becomes increasingly critical in several fields. Current approaches for services retrieval are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs. Recent works have demonstrated that this approach is not sufficient to discover relevant components. In this paper we argue that, in many situations, the service discovery should be based on the specification of service behavior (in particular, the conversation protocol). The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. To do so, we reduce the problem of behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and we adapt existing algorithms for this purpose. A prototype is presented (available as a web service) which takes as input two conversation protocols and evaluates the semantic distance between them; the prototype provides also the script of edit operations that can be used to alter the first model to render it identical with the second one.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371047,Using constraint hierarchies to support QoS-guided service composition.,"A key impediment to the widespread adoption of web services is the is the relatively limited set of tools available to deal with Quality-of-Service (QoS) factors [12]. QoS factors pose several difficult challenges in how they may be articulated. While the functional requirements of a service can be represented as predicates to be satisfied by the target system, QoS factors are effectively statements of objectives to be maximized or minimized. QoS requirements occur naturally as local specifications of preference. Dealing with QoS factors is therefore a multi-objective optimization problem. In effect, these objectives are never fully satisfied, but satisficed to varying degrees. In evaluating alternative design decisions, we need to trade-off varying degrees of satisfaction of potentially mutually contradictory non-functional requirements. One key contribution of this work is the use of the constraint hierarchies framework from hierarchical constraint logic programming framework in dealing with Quality of Service(QoS) factors . We show how QoS factors can be formulated as soft constraints and how the machinery associated with constraint hierarchies can be used to evaluate the alternative trade-offs involved in seeking to satisfy a set of QoS factors that might pull in different directions. We apply also this approach to the problem of reasoning about web service selection and composition, and establish that significant value can be derived from such an exercise.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371048,Mapping Service Level Agreements in 3-tier settings.,"A telecom operator (""service provider"",SP) offers various services to subscribed customers by partnering with various third party providers (""content provider"",CP). The SP acts as a liaison between subscribers and partners. One of the main functions of the SP, therefore, is to match the ""demand"" of the subscribers with the ""supply"" of the CPs. Such a matching is a prerequisite for efficient service selection while ensuring customer satisfaction, and is useful for optimisation, such as resource allocation and load balancing. The ""demand"" requirements and ""supply"" guarantees can be concretized using Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLAs can be expressed formally using standards such as WSLA or WS-Agreement. We present a system that automates the task of finding a matching between these two sets, subscriber-SP and SP-CP, of SLAs. First, the SLAs are normalised to a common denominator, then composed if required, and finally the matching engine computes and outputs the map. The matching algorithm, which is of central importance, compares logical expressions involving predicates. The logical expressions are first converted into CNFform, and instead of naive O(m Ã— n) comparisons, we develop a more efficient approach to solve the problem. As a proof-of-concept, we have implemented a prototype as an Eclipse plugin.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371049,PWSSec: Process for Web Services Security.,"In the last few years, the field of Web Services (WS) security has evolved rapidly producing an impressive number of WS-based security standards. This fact has caused that organizations are still reticent about adopting technologies based on this paradigm due to the learning curve necessary to integrate security into their practical deployments. In this paper, we present PWSSec (Process for Web Services Security) as a process that enables the integration of a set of specific stages into the traditional phases of WS-based systems development providing them with security. PWSSec is composed of three stages, WSSecReq (Web Services Security Requirements), WSSecArch (Web Services Security Architecture) and WSSecTech (Web Services Security Technologies) that allow the specification of WS-specific security requirements, the definition of the WS-based security architecture and the identification of the security standards that the security architecture must deploy, respectively.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371050,A Flexible and Efficient Approach to Reconcile Different Web Services-based Event Notification Specifications.,"Event notification plays an important role in the orchestration of distributed systems. Web services-based event notification is an important step to achieve an interoperable messaging system on the Internet scale. However, different incompatible specifications have been proposed to specify the Web services interfaces for Web services-based event notification systems. The WS-Eventing specification and the WS-Notification specifications are two major initiatives. WSMessenger is our implementation of both specifications. A mediation approach is used to reconcile the differences between these two specifications. In this paper, we propose a ""Normalization-Processing-Customization"" (NPC) model for mediation among competing Web services and show how this model is used in WS-Messenger to reconcile the incompatibility between these two specifications. The NPC model is flexible and scalable. The mediation implementation in WS-Messenger is efficient with a very small overhead.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371051,QoS Explorer: A Tool for Exploring QoS in Composed Services.,"This paper presents QoS Explorer, an interactive tool we have developed which predicts quality of service (QoS) of a workflow from the QoS characteristics of its constituents, even when the relationships involved are complex. This facilitates design and instantiation of workflows to satisfy QoS constraints, as it enables the user to discover and focus effort on the aspects of a workflow which most affect their primary QoS concerns, thus improving efficiency of workflow development. Further, the underlying model we use is more sophisticated than those of similar recent work [13, 2, 18], and includes processing of entire statistical distributions and probabilistic states (instead of the simple numeric constants used elsewhere) to model such nonconstant variables as execution time.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371052,On Encrypting and Signing Binary XML Messages in the Wireless Environment.,"In the wireless world there has recently been much interest in alternate serialization formats for XML data, mostly driven by the weak capabilities of both devices and networks. However, an alternate serialization format is not easily made compatible with XML security features such as encryption and signing. We consider here ways to integrate an alternate format with security, and present a solution that we see as a viable alternative. In addition to this, we present extensive performance measurements, including ones on a mobile phone, on the effect of an alternate format when using XML-based security. These measurements indicate that, in the wireless world, reducing message sizes is the most pressing concern, and that processing efficiency gains of an alternate format are a much lesser concern.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371053,Static Verification of Control and Data inWeb Service Compositions.,"The data exchanged among the web services participating to a composition are clearly very relevant for a correct behavior of the composition. Nevertheless, most of the approaches existing in the literature for the static verification of web service compositions ignore data, or require very small ranges to be associated to the data types. In this paper, we propose an approach for the verification of web service compositions that takes into account the data flows among the component process. The approach exploits abstraction techniques for modeling those aspects of data that are relevant for the correctness of the composition and hiding the aspects that are irrelevant. We show that building the right abstraction corresponds to defining those assumptions on the data manipulations performed by the component services which are crucial for the correctness of the composition.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371054,Representation Verification and Computation of Timed Properties in Web.,"In this paper we address the problem of qualitative and quantitative analysis of timing aspects of Web service compositions defined as a set of BPEL4WS processes. We introduce a formalism, called Web Service Timed State Transition Systems (WSTTS), to capture the timed behavior of the composite web services. We also exploit an interval temporal logic to express complex timed assumptions and requirements on the system's behavior. Building on top of this formalization, we provide techniques and tools for modelchecking BPEL4WS compositions against time-related requirements. We also present a symbolic algorithm that can be used to compute duration bounds of behavioral intervals that satisfy such requirements. We perform a preliminary experimental evaluation of our approach and tools with the help of an e-Government case study.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371055,E Role-based Decomposition of Business Processes using BPEL.,"This paper addresses role-based decomposition of a business process model (based on a subset of WS-BPEL, using explicit data link)s. A mechanism is presented for partitioning a business process so that each partition can be enacted by a different participant. An important goal is to disconnect the partitioning itself from the design of the business process, simplifying the reassignment of activities to different entities. The result is several (compliant) BPEL processes, one for each participant, as well as the information needed to wire them together at deployment time and ensuring correct instance-level connections at runtime. We present details of partitioning and successfully running a sample process with three participants.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371056,BizCast: Business Process Performance Model with Workload Overlap Analysis.,"In today's fast and ever changing business environments, it is very important to quickly adapt business processes to new business requirements, and to optimize their performance. From this viewpoint, business process performance prediction plays a key role in directing the business. Previous studies have shown that a network queuing model is able to predict the business process performance. In order to do this, the model requires details of the service's inside behavior. This paper presents a business process performance model called 'BizCast', which enables us to estimate business process execution time under any given condition and not to require details of the service's inside behavior. We especially focus on the overlap between business process instances to predict the performance based on the outside behavior. Prototype evaluation of the service model for supply chain services shows high accuracy, which is, at least, almost 0.9 correlation coefficient.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371057,Opal: SimpleWeb Services Wrappers for Scientific Applications.,"The Grid-based infrastructure enables large-scale scientific applications to be run on distributed resources and coupled in innovative ways. However, in practice, Grid resources are not very easy to use for the end-users who have to learn how to generate security credentials, stage inputs and outputs, access Grid-based schedulers, and install complex client software. There is an imminent need to provide transparent access to these resources so that the endusers are shielded from the complicated details, and free to concentrate on their domain science. Scientific applications wrapped as Web services alleviate some of these problems by hiding the complexities of the back-end security and computational infrastructure, only exposing a simple SOAP API that can be accessed programmatically by applicationspecific user interfaces. However, writing the application services that access Grid resources can be quite complicated, especially if it has to be replicated for every application. In this paper, we present Opal which is a toolkit for wrapping scientific applications as Web services in a matter of hours, providing features such as scheduling, standardsbased Grid security and data management in an easy-to-use and configurable manner.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371058,Expressing and Reasoning about Service Contracts in Service-Oriented Computing.,"The Web Services and Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) vision [6] is about building large-scale distributed applications by composing coarse-grained autonomous services in a flexible architecture that can adapt to changing business requirements. These services interact by exchanging one-way messages through standardised message processing and transport protocols. This vision is being driven by economic imperatives for integration and automation across administrative and organisational boundaries. Service contracts play a critical role in SOA. They describe the functionality a service exposes to other services on the network. A contract defines the outgoing and incoming messages the service can send and receive, and the order in which they are sent and received (messaging behaviour). It provides developers and tools with the metadata to compose services into service-oriented applications. This paper presents a concise yet expressive model for service contracts to describe messaging behaviour. The idea is simple: we use Boolean conditions to specify when a message can be sent and received, where the conditions refer only to other messages in the service contract that is, conditions only refer to a service's externalised messaging state and not to internal state.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371059,Transforming OWL-S Process Model into EDFA for Service Discovery.,"Current web services standards do not well support automatically discovering and selecting services that can be safely integrated with existing components. Semantic matching of service specifications based on the behaviors of web services, i.e., the ways a client may interact with the service, can be used to solve the problem. Therefore, the transformation of the OWL-S process model specifying the behaviors of web services into an extended deterministic finite state automaton (EDFA) is presented in this paper. The automata describe web services in a more accurate way: the nodes represent states maintained by services; the state transitions labelled by binary-tuples (input, output) rather than letters represent communication activities of services; moreover, the automaton structures describe the temporal sequences of communication activities that represents the behaviors of web services.The compatibility of web services can be evaluated with testing the emptiness of the languages accepted by EDFAs.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371060,Improving the performance of XML based technologies by caching and reusing information.,"The growing synergy between Web Services and Gridbased technologies is enabling profound, dynamic interactions between applications dispersed in geographic, institutional, and conceptual space. Such deep interoperability requires the simplicity, robustness, and extensibility for which XML has been conceived, making it a natural lingua franca for the network. Along with these advantages, there is a degree of inefficiency that may limit the applicability of XML. Firstly, we investigate the limitations of XML for highperformance and high-interactive distributed computing. Our experimental results clearly show that focusing on parsers, that are routinely used for desterilize XML messages exchanged in these system, we can improve the performance of a generic the end to end web services based solution. Secondly we present a new parser, the Cache Parser, which uses a cache to reduce the parsing time sender and receiver side, by reusing information related to previously parsed documents/messages similar to the one under examination. Finally, we will show how our fast parser can improve the global throughput of any application based on Web or Grid Services, or also JAXP-RPC. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is 25 times faster than the fastest algorithm in the market and, if used in a WS scenario, can dramatically increase the number of requests per second handled by a server (up to 150% of improvement) bringing it close to a system that does not use xml at all.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371061,Semantic Modeling and Design Patterns for Asynchronous Events in Web Service Interaction.,"This paper proposes a conceptual model for modeling static and dynamic event sources by reusing the information in WSDL. A set-theoretic semantics for event subscription is introduced, based on which two metrics, recall and precision, are proposed to measure the accuracy of event subscriptions. We discuss the accuracy of several event subscription strategies under the framework of current web service event subscription standard proposals (WS-Eventing and WS-Notification). Four major types of event broker design patterns are discussed based on two visibility/reachability factors: if sink knows the source and if source can deliver events directly to the sink. The implication on the broker state and message routing is studied in this analysis. A prototype implementation indicated that these design patterns are feasible.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371062,Discovery of Semantic Relations between Web Services.,"Discovering and assembling individual Web services into more complex yet new and more useful Web processes has received significant attention from academia recently. In this paper, we explore using pre and post-conditions of Web services to enable their automatic composition. Also, we present a novel technique for discovering semantic relations between pre and post-conditions of different services using their ontological descriptions. This enables determining services with complementary functions and generating a semantic Web of services. Our technique takes semantic similarity of pre and post-conditions into account and builds on our earlier work on discovering semantic relationships between interfaces (input and output) of Web services. A comprehensive classification of existing composition techniques is also included.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371063,TARGET: Two-way Web Service Router Gateway.,"In this paper, we present the approach and architecture of TARGET: Two-way Web Service Router Gateway, for two-way web service interaction crossing enterprise domain and firewall. It provides a full support for asynchronous outbound operation and event notification in communication services. TARGET addresses an acute issue for internet applications that today's enterprise NATs and firewalls only allow outbound HTTP request from the inside to the outside and block any request from the outside to the inside, which is a serious problem for two-way web services. TARGET is a generic solution to allow two-way web service interaction to traverse legitimately through NATs and strictly configured firewalls; and it is based on two-way SOAP message tunneling, service local registry, and service routing to bridge two-way web service interaction. A research TARGET system has been implemented and applied to real time communication services, e.g. conferencing. Extensive experiments on TARGET are performed, and its performance with various sizes of SOAP messages is studied. The applicability and feasibility of TARGET for two-way web service interaction is verified.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

371065,Modelling End-to-end Quality-of-Service for Transaction-Based Services in Multi-Domain Environments.,"Next-generation service offerings will integrate information from multiple interconnected servers. For the commercial success of these services, the ability to deliver good end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) is crucial. Today, no mature solutions exist for the problem of realizing high and guaranteed end-to-end QoS for transaction-based services in multi-domain environments. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are a well-recognized concept to obtain QoS guarantees, but currently no satisfactory solutions exist for SPs to determine the set of combinations of per-domain SLAs that they need to negotiate with the other domain owners to deliver the desired end-to-end QoS. To this end, in this paper we introduce the new concept called SLA negotiation space, i.e. the set of combinations of per-domain SLAs that SPs need to negotiate with other domain owners to realize desired end-to-end QoS levels. In addition, to identify the SLA negotiation space, we propose a modelling framework to quantify the complex relation between the per-domain SLA parameters and the end-to-end QoS. The practical usefulness of our results is demonstrated by a realistic example.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371066,Augmenting Web Services Composition with Transactional Requirements.,"Current Web services composition approaches do not take into account transactional requirements defined by designers. The transactional challenges raised by the composition of Web services are twofold: relaxed atomicity and dynamicity. In this paper, we propose a new process to automate the design of transactional composite Web services. Our solution enables the composition ofWeb services not only according to functional requirements but also to transactional ones defined using the Acceptable Termination States model. The resulting composite Web service is compliant with the consistency requirements expressed by designers and its execution can easily be coordinated using the coordination rules provided as an outcome of our approach.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Now it is important to face how to model systems based on service functionality and also how to add extra-functional properties to them. This is the reason why we propose first of all a versatile and simple UML profile based on the Service Component Architecture specification for modeling services and, secondly, a new UML profile is proposed in order to model and reuse extra-functional properties in the named models. Besides, the property profile provides enough information to enable property code and description generation at a later stage.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper, we present a novel approach that utilizes the case based reasoning methodology for modelling dynamic Web service discovery and matchmaking. Our framework considers Web services execution experiences in the decision making process and is highly adaptable to the service requester constraints. The framework also utilises OWL semantic descriptions extensively for implementing both the components of the CBR engine and the matchmaking profile of the Web services.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371070,Preventing Service Oriented Denial of Service (PreSODoS): A Proposed Approach.,"Today Web services have grown in context of both business to business (B2B) and business to customer (B2C) applications. Web services are the most popular mode of implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). With this growth and acceptance in the industry, the role of security is crucial. Most of the existing security mechanisms in Web services like XML encryption[4], digital signatures[3], user tokens etc. provide security on one basic assumption that source of the request is legitimate. But a typical Denial of Service attacker can use these sources as reflectors and play around with the contents of a Web service body to create an attack scenario. In this paper, we propose PreSODoS - a framework to detect and prevent XML based Denial of Service (XDoS) attacks on Web services based applications. The framework relies on content introspection to detect any XDoS possibility. We use a Patricia Trie based representation so that the schemas and the request messages can be compared and validated in a performance efficient manner. PreSODoS is capable of detecting any repetitive request message and sense an attack scenario and trigger corresponding prevention mechanisms.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

The architecture is build on top of a simple and extensible core that provides the basic abstractions for the rest of the system. We present the design and the thought process behind the key abstractions by breaking down the architecture in to three topics, XML Processing Model, Extensible SOAP processing model and Messaging Framework.

Interoperability is the capability of multiple, autonomous and heterogeneous systems to use each other's services effectively.

The new concepts include the super-space of exception definitions, the meta-definition mode, and components in an exception message.

371077,Adding Authentication to Model Driven Security.,"As Service-Oriented Architecture has become popular, security has been a critical issue in multiple security domains using the WS-Security framework. The authentication requirements depend on the application semantics, but configuring authentication is very difficult for someone who is not a security expert, such as an application developer, because it is necessary to understand platform-specific security features and authentication mechanisms. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a framework for platformindependent security configuration based on the Model Driven Architecture. In this paper, we introduce a security qualifier, which is an abstract annotation for specifying authenticated identity on a platform-independent model, and a Security Infrastructure Model which is a model including the platform information required for creating security policies. These ideas make authentication configuration possible without understanding the platform-specific information, such as the federation of the security domain and the relationships of trust between the servers. Our framework allows a non-security expert to configure security easily. We show how to configure the authentication for an ID propagation scenario and discuss advantages of our framework compared to existing tools.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371078,IntegratingWeb Services and Messaging.,"Web Services and Messaging, as application-toapplication communication paradigms, have so far been considered separately, with independent programming models and supporting middleware. Different efforts are now introducing messaging notions such as asynchrony, greater consumer cardinality, and looser coupling between web services. This trend will likely result in an extension of the web services programming model. It is not clear, however, that this extension will adhere to a pre-planned approach. A coherent approach requires a thorough integration of the web services and messaging paradigms. This paper proposes one such approach which, in addition to supporting the current style of web services interactions, allows the incorporation of messaging-style interactions under a common programming model. These messaging-style interactions include asynchronous request-response, oneway multi-consumer interactions, and even multiple-choice point-to-point interactions, common in message queuing systems. This paper also elaborates on a model for oneway multi-consumer interactions that integrates the publish/ subscribe mode of messaging into the web services programming model. A primary motivation for our approach is to take advantage of key messaging features, while exerting as small an impact as possible on the web services programming model.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371079,Process Guided Service Composition in Building SoA Solutions: A Data Driven Approach.,"Solution design has been more of an art than an engineering discipline. Lots of researchers and practitioners have proposed and exercised different kinds of approaches with varied success. Most of these methods seem to have focused on building new solutions from scratch. However, enterprise solutions today are mostly built on top of an existing IT infrastructure. The notion of SoA is trying to pave a way to integrate heterogeneous components together to meet new business needs. When a new requirement is given to a system developer in the form of business processes, it would be ideal if s/he can make the best of existing services for many reasons. In this paper we propose a data driven approach to provide service composition guidance to implement the given requirement. Based on the relations among business domain data and service domain data, we can generate additional data mediations according to three composition rules. With these data relations and composition rules, we give a formal approach to devise choreography of services from current service portfolio, plus additional data mediation artifacts to realize a given requirement. Our work can be seen as an effort to bridge the gap between business and service domain.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,
371080,Decomposition and Abstraction of Web Applications for Web Service Extraction and Composition.,"There are large demands for re-engineering humanoriented Web application systems for use as machineoriented Web application systems, which are called Web Services. This paper describes a framework named H2W, which can be used for constructing Web Service wrappers from existing, multi-paged Web applications. H2Ws contribution is mainly for service extraction, rather than for the widely studied problem of data extraction. For the framework, we propose a page-transition- based decomposition model and a page access abstraction model with context propagation. With the proposed decomposition and abstraction, developers can flexibly compose a Web Service wrapper oftheir intent by describing a simple worwow program incorporating the advantages of previous work on Web data extraction. We show three successful wrapper application examples with H2 W for real world Web applications.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

Recently, Web services for network management has been enabling the investigation of more sophisticate management solutions, even though some concerns related to the Web services performance have been initially exposed, but quickly disappeared after the first research results. In this paper we show that Web services technologies have more to offer to the network management discipline than just bridging established network management protocols and Web services protocols. Particularly we explore the possibility of using Web services composition applied to network management. If successful, Web services composition can bring to network management the solution for some key problems yet to be solved, such as retrieving the information from several different devices and yet being able to use a simple and fast interface at the manager side. We present Web services composition for network management considering two approaches: in the first one a single network device needs to be contacted and its information composed; in the second one, many devices need to be contacted and the information retrieved from them need to be composed. We show that using proper tools we can not only really use Web services composition for network management, but also that such use can be integrated with traditional management technologies that are unlike to be abandoned in short and mid terms.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper, we present a conversation establishment protocol that uses forwarded trust relationships to solve this problem. In this protocol, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) based Authentication assertions are used to encapsulate the conversation context as well as the conversation target identity authentication information into a secure context token. Our protocol is conformant to the emerging Web services standards of WS-Trust and WSSecureConversation. The implementation of this framework on Java platform and its application to secure a Web services based Grid monitoring system are presented.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper, we introduce an approach to support semantic service descriptions and queries using registries that conform to the UDDI Version 3 specification. Specifically, we present a scheme that allows users to store OWL-S service descriptions in the UDDI data model and use that information to perform semantic query processing. Our approach does not require any modification to the existing UDDI registries. The add-on modules only reside on the client-side machines that wish to take advantage of the semantic capabilities. This approach is completely backward compatible and can integrate seamlessly into the existing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure.",2006,,,,,ICWS,,,

371102,A Semantic QoS-Aware Discovery Framework for Web Services.,"Augmenting web services with explicit semantics forms the foundation of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) automation. As more and more Semantic Web Services (SWSs) are deployed, similar SWSs could have quite different quality-of-service (QoS) levels. The QoS-aware discovery becomes an important challenge. While some efforts try to solve it via Constraint Programming (CP), they suffer from the purely syntactic matchmaking method. Furthermore, the construction of constraints and the selection of services are completely dependent on the literal translation from QoS descriptions, which increase obstacles to actually apply CP. In this paper, we propose a semantic QoS-aware framework for SWSs discovery by combining the semantic matchmaking and CP. Initially, a QoS ontology is presented to define QoS data into service descriptions. Then the ontology reasoning is adopted to change previous syntactic matchmaking into a semantic way. Through confirming the compatibility of concepts, complex QoS conditions are solved as constraints and a selection algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal offer. Finally, the prototype implementation of our framework is discussed and a SWSs discovery case is used to illustrate the comprehensive discovery process.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371103,A Framework for the Semantic Composition of Web Services Handling User Constraints.,"In this work, we present a framework for the semantic composition of web services based on Statecharts and uniform community service descriptions. Our model is a two step process. In the first step, we derive the execution model of the user's query. The execution model is specified in Statecharts formalism; whereas the user's query is described in OWL-S. Therefore, a mapping from Statecharts formalism to OWL-S is developed. In the second step, we instantiate the developed execution model through invocation of available e-services instances. Hence, and a result, we obtain an execution plan (said also strategy) satisfying user constraints. The key features of the proposed framework could be summarized as follows. First, unlike other existing languages, using OWL-S enables the semantic description of e-services. These semantics are taken into consideration in our composition strategy. Second, the user constraints (or preferences) are taken into account during composition and are expressed as a finite set of logical formulas with the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) language.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371104,A Faceted Requirements-Driven Approach to Service Design and Composition.,"The Web Services research community has proposed a number of approaches for service composition, ranging from manual to semi-automatic to completely automatic. However, it is often difficult to take independently developed services and compose them, since they may not work together correctly. For service composition to occur, the services in question must be designed and developed in a manner that facilitates their composition. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for service design and composition that combines top-down and bottom-up elements. Our approach is driven by faceted, tag-based functional requirements provided by end-users. These requirements describe, at a high-level, the families of compositions that end-users desire. The requirements kick off a top-down service development lifecycle, where enterprise architects and service developers design, develop and test workflows and services, possibly reusing existing flows and services in the process. At runtime, end-users can specify goals, which are satisfied through a bottom-up composition of flows from the available services. The composed flows include those explicitly designed by the architects as well as new ones that are assembled in a serendipitous manner from the available services. With examples from a case study in the Financial Services domain, we demonstrate our approach for designing and developing services that can be composed into myriad workflows based on end-user goals.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371107,Towards a Reversible BPEL Debugger.,"Despite the great momentum gained about the testing, analysis and verification of BPEL process, little attention has paid to the debugging issues, especially about the building of ad hoc debuggers. In this paper, we propose and implement RBDB (Reversible BPEL DeBugger), a specially made reversible debugger for BPEL process. RBDB is built on the abstract debugging APIs to fulfill itsfunctionality. A reversible concurrent debugging model and three strategies to handle different type of external web services are introduced later. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of experiment data are presented. Evaluation results demonstrate that RBDB can improve users' efficiency significantly and decrease the invoking times of external services substantially.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371108,Realizing an Open Ubiquitous Environment in a RESTful Way.,"Web services have been widely used to support context-aware applications for context information retrieval in a ubiquitous environment. However, most of the existing research efforts in this field only focus on using SOAP web service as an enabling technology. In this paper, we compare REST and SOAP web services for supporting ubiquitous environments. We describe our approaches to deploy an open ubiquitous computing environment using REST style services along with semantic web and mobile technologies. We also discuss an example context-aware application developed for the environment and show how REST style services can contribute in moving ubiquitous computing technologies into the real world.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371109,Toward the Development of Contextually Aware Business Applications via Model-Driven Transformations.,"While the traditional model driven development techniques are useful for building solutions in a reusable manner, they do not say much about how the existing assets in a client environment can be leveraged effectively and efficiently. In this work, we enhance model driven transformation techniques to generate implementation artifacts on a given platform from platform independent models while leveraging the existing assets in a client environment. We apply semantic Web service matching technology to achieve automatic binding of generated artifacts with available client assets. By generating implementation artifacts that are bound where appropriate with clientsâ€™ existing functionality, our approach helps cut down the development time during project implementations and thereby resulting in reduced project durations and costs. We demonstrate the feasibility of the two platforms: IBM WebSphere and SAP NetWeaver. Lessons learned are presented.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper we consider the selection of services in a dynamic environment with changing requirements.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for context-aware Semantic Web Services which is applicable for any environment. It is established based on composition of context provider Web Services and other context-aware Semantic Web Services. In addition, an extended version of the Semantic Web Service Ontology Language for Semantic Web services is introduced, in order to make it possible to find appropriate context-aware Semantic Web services based on available context information. So as to make it applicable for any environment, the solution does not hold any assumption about the user's context source. Rather, the property of Context Level is defined.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371114,A Hybrid Integrated Architecture for Language Service Composition.,This paper reports on our experiences with combining Heart of Gold and Language Grid technology to provide more language resources available on Web. Heart of Gold is known as middleware architecture for integrating deep and shallow Natural Language Processing components. The Language Grid is an infrastructure built on top of the Internet to provide distributed language services. Having Heart of Gold available as Web services in the Language Grid environment would contribute to interoperability among language services.,2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371115,On Synchronizing with Web Service Evolution.,"To catch up with today's fast changing business markets, web services has never slowed down its paces for evolution. As a consequence, service consumers have to employ in-time upgrades to guarantee continuous business integrity and avoid unnecessary runtime errors in their IT systems. However, a new web service release can involve hundreds of changes, and thus it is non-trivial for the service consumer to rapidly track and adopt relevant changes. This paper proposes a framework for facilitating the service consumer to keep synchronized with the web service evolution. On the service side, a Service Invocation Monitor is installed to monitor the interaction history of the client, a Service Delta Analyzer exports the service delta into well-formatted document, and a Release Note Customizer is configured to customize the full release note produced using the monitored interaction history and exported service delta. On the client side, the Consumer Code Customizer is used by the consumer developer to highlight the code fragments to be changed and provide facilitation linkages between the code fragments and the customized release note. An example is shown to demonstrate the usefulness of our proposal.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371123,Anchor Semantics Enabled Ranking Method for Service Discovery and Integration.,"As web services proliferate, the discovery and integration of appropriate services will become a challenging task particularly with services that share common similarities and functionalities. To assist requesters to find Web services of interest easily, we need to enhance the present service discovery mechanisms with ranking method. Enlightened by disciplines of Web 2.0, the anchor semantics enabled ranking method is proposed. In this method, the service requestor, as a consumer, can also become the producer to contribute not only the request description but also the usage reputation as part of service description. Based on case study and analogical analysis, we argue that this method improves recall and precise metrics at the same time.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371124,Make the Consumable Services via REST.,"Making your enterprise data and traditional web services consumable through the World Wide Web is becoming increasingly important for a organization.

This tutorial will teach you the basic of REST and the related application architecture, the Atom Publishing Protocol (APP) and how it stitches each resource in the service architecture, the best practices in constructing the REST services, and how to utilize and integrate other REST services with your existing web service and application. Furthermore, it will also show you how to effectively use and consume the REST services from the IBM social software (Lotus Connections) in order to build your own social web applications.

Web service composition has been studied and, amongst other methods, the use of natural computing methods has been proposed previously. In this paper, we address the need for a fast response when computing the most suitable sequence of services. In particular, we propose a novel heuristic immune algorithm with an efficient encoding and mutation method. The algorithm involves two steps: an immune selection operation, which is maintaining antibody population diversity and a clonal selection. The use of a vaccine during the evolution provides heuristic information that accelerates the convergence. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed heuristic immune algorithm is very effective in improving the convergence speed.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371131,Lazy XML Parsing/Serialization Based on Literal and DOM Hybrid Representation.,"Distributed SOA computing environments usually use SOAP intermediaries that sit between senders and receivers to mediate SOAP messages. The intermediaries may add support services to the SOAP message exchange, such as routing, logging, and security. The typical processing by a SOAP intermediary is parsing the incoming SOAP messages, checking the data in each message, and then serializing the messages to put them back into the network. DOM is one of the popular interfaces to navigate an XML tree. Existing DOM implementations are not efficient for SOAP intermediary processing. Existing DOM implementations parse XML data to create tree data and traverse the tree data for serialization. Typically, a SOAP intermediary rarely modifies the tree data. In such situations, creating the tree data and serializing it back into XML data is computationally expensive. We propose a DOM implementation based on a hybrid data representation that uses both literal XML and DOM objects. In our implementation, a SOAP intermediary stores the original literal XML representation and reuses it to avoid traversing all of the tree data during serialization. We prototyped the DOM implementation and evaluated its performance.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371132,A Distributed Replication Strategy Evaluation and Selection Framework for Fault Tolerant Web Services.,"Redundancy-based fault tolerance strategies are proposed for building reliable Service-Oriented Architectures/Applications (SOA), which are usually developed on the unpredictable remote Web services. This paper proposes and implements a distributed replication strategy evaluation and selection framework for fault tolerant Web services. Based on this framework, we provide a systematic comparison of various replication strategies by theoretical formula and real-world experiments. Moreover, a userparticipated strategy selection algorithm is designed and verified. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the advantage of this framework. In these experiments, users from six different locations all over the world perform evaluation of Web services distributed in six countries. Over 1,000,000 test cases are executed in a collaborative manner and detailed results are also provided.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371133,A Trust Vector Approach to Service-Oriented Applications.,"Trust is a critical issue in e-commerce and e-service environments. In some applications (such as eBay), the trust management mechanisms have been introduced to provide valuable information to buyers prior to placing orders and making payments. Meanwhile, the trust issue is also actively studied in the research community. However, most studies and applications focus on approaches that result in a single trust value to represent the trust level of sellers or service providers. Such a simple trust evaluation method may not be able to depict the trust history exactly and may leave misleading information to service customers. In this paper, we present a novel approach of trust vector consisting of three values to reflect the trust level with more indications.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

One of the reasons for this is the inability in most current workflow languages to support large and complex applications that require workflow integration and data sharing between workflows. In this paper, this issue is addressed by the introduction of the two approaches used in the Service Workflow Language (SWFL): the Procedure-Oriented approach, and the Objected-Oriented approach, for workflow integration. The data sharing and related synchronization issues that are associated with these workflow integration approaches are also discussed.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Composite services have to operate in an open and dynamically changing environment in order to leverage the best performing services available at the moment. Hence, there is the need for an efficient mechanism to provide reliable service rankings. In this paper we present a novel, generic, and customizable reputation infrastructure to automatically and transparently monitor the execution of composite services, taking both functional and non-functional properties into account. The experienced Web service Quality-of-Service is communicated to a configurable reputation mechanism that publishes service rankings. Our reputation infrastructure supports notifications upon changes in service reputation, enabling self-tuning and self-healing properties in the execution of composite services. We implemented our architecture using standard technologies, such as BPEL and JavaEE. Performance measurements show that our infrastructure causes only moderate overhead.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371141,A Formal Model of Human Workflow.,"BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) has become the standard for specifying and executing workflow specifications for Web service composition invocation. A major weakness of BPEL is the lack of so-called ""human workflow"" support. The BPEL4People specification tries to amend this by adding human task support to BPEL. In this paper, we propose a formal model of BPEL4People using the CSP process algebra, and discuss some issues we found through analyzing the model. Although based on BPEL4People, this is a general work, and can also be viewed as a formal model of human workflow.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371142,A Framework for Verifying SLA Compliance in Composed Services.,"Service level agreements (SLAs) impose many non-functional requirements on services. Business analysts specify and check these requirements in business process models using tools such as IBM WebSphere Business Modeler. System integrators on the other hand use service composition tools such as IBM WebSphere Integration Developer to create service composition models, which specify the integration of services. However, system integrators rarely verify SLA compliance in their proposed composition designs. Instead, SLA compliance is verified after the composed services are deployed in the field. To improve the quality of the composed services, we propose a framework to verify SLA compliance in composed services at design time. The framework re-uses information in business process models to simulate services and verify the non-functional requirements before the service deployment. To demonstrate our framework, we built a prototype using an industrial process simulation engine from IBM WebSphere Business Modeler and integrate it into an industrial service composition tool. Through a case study, we demonstrate that our framework and the prototype assist system integrators in composing services while considering the non-functional requirements.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371143,Discovering Reference Process Models by Mining Process Variants.,"Recently, a new generation of adaptive Process-Aware Information Systems (PAIS) has emerged, which allows for dynamic process and service changes (e.g., to insert, delete, and move activities and service executions in a running process). This, in turn, has led to a large number of process variants derived from the same model, but differing in structure due to the applied changes. Generally, such process variants are expensive to configure and difficult to maintain. This paper provides a sophisticated approach which fosters learning from past process changes and allows for mining process variants. As a result we obtain a generic process model for which the average distance between this model and the respective process variants becomes minimal. By adopting this generic model in the PAIS, need for future process configuration and adaptation decreases. We have validated the proposed mining method and implemented it in a powerful proof-of-concept prototype.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Unlike typical enterprise scenarios, where applications are required to be service enabled, the key requirement here was to service enable its data acquisition, quality check, reporting and other processes which are either mostly manual or ETL based workflows. This paper also addresses how shared services, business processes, rules, and semantics are used to provide quality and agility to the internal processes many of which are entirely dependent on the type of data received. The case and the scenario are chosen specifically to emphasize the fact, that mere web-services implementation does not lead to service oriented architecture, but it is the appropriate usage of them.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper we focus on modeling and discovery of generic data providing services (DPS), with the goal of making data providing services available for interactions with service requesters in contexts such as service composition and mediation. In our model RDF Views are used to represent the content provided by the DPS. A characterization of match between description of DPS as RDF Views and the OWL-S service request is specified, based on which we developed a flexible matchmaking algorithm for discovery of data providing services. Finally, we propose a realization of the DPS using a SOAP version of the SPARQL protocol and a dynamic configuration interface allowing easy interactions of service requesters with data providing services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371168,Publishing Dynamic State Changes of Resources through State Aware WSDL.,"A common architecture in today's development of distributed systems is the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) implemented using web services. Until recently, it was difficult to build a SOA based grid/distributed system using web services due to the inability to learn the state of services. The state of a web service could only be accessed through specialized clients and/or services. Should the specialized client or service fail, the state can't be accessed. This paper shows the innovative Resources Via Web Instances (RVWI) framework. RVWI grants to web services the ability to show the state of dynamic resources in their WSDL. This was achieved via software components called Connectors which watch for any changes in a resource and updates the web service. The significance of this report is the support for resources which can change state between requests and the innovation is the improvement of state updates between the service and discovery services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371169,Declarative Constraint Framework for SOA Deployment and Configuration.,"A generalized declarative constraint framework is proposed in this paper to address challenges of applying constraints to model-driven SOA deployment and configuration. By representing deployment metamodel and domain knowledge as patterns, constraints can be easily described, automatically validated and analyzed. This framework reduces the human-intensiveness and error-proneness in the activity of applying constraints to a SOA deployment topology. We implemented this framework over a model-driven SOA deployment platform leveraging OCL as the declarative constraint language, and verified it in industry deployment scenarios.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

At the same time, with the trend towards multicore CPUs, parallelization to improve performance has become increasingly relevant. In previous work, we have investigated parallelizing DOM-style parsing and gained significant speedup. For streaming XML applications, however, SAX-style parsing is often required. In this paper, we present a technique and implementation of a parallel XML SAX parser. To handle inherent data dependencies in XML while still allowing reasonable scalability, we use a 4-stage software pipeline with a combination of strictly sequential stages and stages that can be further data-parallelized within the stage. We thus utilize a hybrid between pipelined parallelism and data parallelism. To demonstrate effectiveness, we test this approach on a Linux machine with two Intel Xeon L5320 CPUs for a total of 8 physical cores, and obtain good speedup up to about 8 CPUs.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

This paper proposes a service composition scheme that uses a combination of Integer Programming, case-based reasoning, and, genetic algorithms techniques. The scheme reduces the service composition costs by reusing existing compositions. Experiments show that, compared with solutions purely based on Integer Programming, the proposed scheme is effective in reducing the time for carrying out service composition.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371180,Extending WS-Notification with an Expressive Event Notification Broker.,"Web service applications integrate explicit client-service interactions with notification-style programming. Such event-driven interactions are often called implicit invocations because the notification message is not in itself a business interaction. Rather, it is used to implicitly trigger such interactions as a means for reacting to events. Web Services specifications such as WS-Notification have been developed in order to standardize the way notifications are sent, but they only support the most basic form of event notification. In this paper, we discuss the architecture and the implementation of an expressive notification broker based on extension mechanisms presented by the WS-Notification specification. This broker improves the standard WSN broker in three ways. First, it supports event correlation and hence allows for composite event detection. Second, it integrates events and reactions into Event-Condition-Action (ECA) rules that can be registered directly at the broker. Third, it introduces event-driven lifecycle management for ECA rules, thus allowing to dynamically adapt these ECA rules to changing situations.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371184,Generalized Semantics-Based Service Composition.,"Service-oriented computing (SOC) has emerged as the eminent market environment for sharing and reusing service-centric capabilities. The underpinning for an organization's use of SOC techniques is the ability to discover and compose Web services. Although industry approaches to composition have a strong notion of business processes, these approaches largely use syntactic descriptions. As such composition is limited since the true functionality of ambiguous service operations cannot be inferred. Alternatively, academia uses semantic approaches to disambiguate services, but, at the same time, most of these approaches neglect the process rigor needed for complex compositions. In this paper we present a generalized semantics-based technique for automatic service composition that combines the rigor of process-oriented composition with the descriptiveness of semantics. Our generalized approach extends the common practice of linearly linked services by introducing the use of a conditional directed acyclic graph (DAG) where complex interactions, containing control flow, information flow and pre/post conditions, are effectively represented. Furthermore, the composition can be represented semantically as OWL-S documents. Our contributions are applied for automatic workflow generation in context of the currently important bioinformatics domain.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Considering that it is the W3C candidate recommendation for web service choreography, it is worth providing a systematic approach for its modeling, analysis and verification. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto industry standard for modeling. Applying UML to model WS-CDL is obviously a promising solution to bring together academics and practitioners in through a unique standard language. This paper proposes to use different UML diagrams to model WS-CDL. Given the UML specification of WS-CDL, we then provide a systematic way of formally analyzing and verifying WS-CDL.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371187,QoS-Driven Selection of Web Services for Transactional Composition.,"Web services composition has been gaining interest over the last years as it leverages the capabilities to offer complex operations resulting from the aggregation of Web services offered by different organizations. As composite Web services are often long-running, loosely coupled and cross-organizational applications, advanced transactional support is required to ensure reliable execution. In addition, in the presence of multiple Web services with equivalent functionality, users will discriminate the alternatives based on their quality of service (QoS). This paper address the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics defined using a quality model. In this model, Web services are selected in a way that satisfies user preferences. These preferences are expressed as weights over QoS criterion and as risk level defining semantically the transactional requirements.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371194,A Unified Design Method of Asynchronous Service-Oriented Architecture Based on the Models and Patterns of Asynchronous Message Exchanges.,"This article proposes a unified methodology for designing asynchronous SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) based on the asynchronous messaging models and patterns. Conventional SOA focuses on synchronous messaging. Although asynchronous messaging provides much efficient and productive way to coordinate services, design of aSOA (asynchronous SOA) is far more complicated due to the variety of messaging and architecture while assuring behavioral consistency of architecture. This paper proposes a model-driven design methodology for aSOA. The methodology is based on aMEPs (Asynchronous Message Exchange Patterns) identified by classifying the messaging in terms of behavioral concerns. Based on the meta-model of aSOA, a set of aSOA patterns is generated by composing aMEPs. Then, an aSOA pattern is selected and transformed to a platform specific aSOA on top of Web services standards. We successfully implemented an aSOA on Apache Axis, which enables to asynchronous messaging of SOAP over SMTP. We demonstrated that conventional methods are subsets of the proposed methodology, which is the major contribution of this work.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371195,A Distributed e-Education System Based on the Service Oriented Architecture.,"Large-scale distributed system, such as educational system, are difficult to develop due to their complex and decentralized nature. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a new form of distributed software architecture. The Service Oriented Architecture facilitates the development of such systems by supporting modular design, application integration and interoperation, and software reuse. With open standards, such as XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI, the Service Oriented Architecture supports interoperability between services operating on different platforms and between applications implemented in different programming languages. In this paper, In this paper, we propose software architecture for design and develop for a distributed e-education system in the way of service oriented architecture. We will explain what this e-education system concerns, how it is developed, and what services it provides.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371196,An Overview and Evaluation of Web Services Security Performance Optimizations.,"WS-Security is an essential component of the Web services protocol stack. WS-Security provides end-to-end security properties (integrity, confidentiality, and authentication) through open XML standards. End-to-end message security assures the participation of non-secure transport intermediaries in message exchanges, which is a key advantage for Web-based systems and service-oriented architectures. However, point-to-point message security based on TLS (Transport Layer Security) is known to significantly outperform WS-Security. In this paper we analyze the overhead of the WS-Security protocol processing stages and evaluate existing and new techniques for WS-Security signature performance optimizations to speed up end-to-end message integrity assurance and authentication.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371197,InfoParser: Infoset Driven XML Processing for Web Services.,"This paper presents InfoParser, an Infoset driven XML processing mechanism aimed to amend current SOAP engines by substituting Infoset, XML binding for Object, XML (O/X) mapping, which is responsible for several acute issues in web services, including O/X impedance mismatch, portability, XML alienation, complexity and memory overhead. The proposed InfoParser approach not only avoids issues in object based framework, but also significantly reduces the complexity in XML centric approach. InfoParser can be described formally by just a few set-theoretic equations, yet it offers a promising alternative to current options in moving web services towards more semantics driven, light weight and loosely coupled programming paradigm that can work on any devices. We have implemented a prototype InfoParser in Java and the preliminary experiments indicate that the approach is feasible.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

With the number of registered web services growing, organization of search results is critical for improving the utility of any service search engine. A clustering view of search results is more effective than traditional ranked-list style in helping users to navigate into relevant services quickly and accurately. In this paper, we will propose an efficient clustering algorithm for organizing returned services. Our experiments validated the efficiency of the proposed method.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Details of communication architecture and interaction among the middleware components is presented and discussed.

371204,A Meta-model for Non-functional Property Descriptions of Web Services.,"In this paper we propose a meta-model for nonfunctional property descriptions targeted to support the selection of Web Services. The approach is based on the explicit distinction between NFP offered by providers and requested by users, on the concept of policy that aggregates NFP descriptions into single entities with an applicability condition, and finally on a set of constraint operators, which is particularly relevant for NFP requests. The semantic meta-model embracing the above perspective is defined by a BNF syntax whose semantics is formalized by an ontology. The ontology has been formalized in OWL-DL and WSML to provide for logical syntax. The logic upon which the meta-model supports NFP-based selection is discussed in the paper.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

This paper analyzed various complex components' relationships (parallel, loops, backup, fault- tolerance, request and response, etc.) how to influence the reliability of the whole system, and solved these complicated relationships to satisfy the Markov property. This work extended the scope of the application of the Markov Model and improved the accuracy of reliability estimation.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

However, designing these rules is time-consuming and error-prone, especially under the condition that current standards barely provide any abstract and high-level guidance. In this spirit, rule analysis and verification for services composition is urgently required to augment its reliability and usability. In this paper, we choose a variant of Description Logics, called ALCO(Q*), as the underlying logic, and provide a formal mapping to transform ECA rules, so that the semantics in the original ECA rules can be captured and are computationally traceable. To this end, we further investigate some important properties for business rules, namely, redundancy, termination and conflict, and propose several sound and complete algorithms to resolve them.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

When an organization develops a service-oriented application in which certain services are provided by external partners, the organization should address the problem of uninformed behavior evolution of external services. This paper proposes an adaptive framework that bars problematic external services to be used in the service-oriented application of an organization. We use dynamic WSDL information in public service registries to approximate a snapshot of a network of services, and apply link analysis on the snapshot to identify services that are popularly used by different service consumers at the moment. As such, service composition can be strategically formed using the highly referenced services. We evaluate our proposal through a simulation study. The results show that, in terms of the number of failures experienced by service consumers, our proposal significantly outperforms the random approach in selecting reliable services to form service compositions.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

We introduce a separated trust management layer for web services that can hold computing components for trust management tasks. A trust management architecture for web services is proposed for building up the trust management layer. The proposed trust management architecture for web services deals with trust requirements, trustevaluation, and trust consumption in web services under a unified umbrella and it provides a solid foundation upon which may evolve the trust management layer for web services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

These degrees are recursively computed by aggregated valuations of ontology-based type matching, logical constraint and relation matching, and syntactic similarity as well. In this paper, we provide results of our experimental evaluation of the performance of WSMO-MX. In summary, it turned out that hybrid semantic matching of WSML-MX services can outperform logic-based only semantic service matching.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

This research investigates semi-automatic transformation of intermediate constraints to concrete constraints for automatic service composition. It considers simultaneously a stack of composition attributes for QoS, preferences, and logic constraints.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371265,Flexible Pattern Monitoring for WS-BPEL through Stateful Aspect Extension.,"The execution of composite web services with WS-BPEL relies on externally autonomous web services. This implies the need to constantly monitor the running behavior of the involved parties. Moreover, monitoring the execution of such processes is critical to enforce business policies and meet reliability goals. This paper proposes a stateful aspect extension to WS-BPEL, as a solution to support flexible behavior pattern monitoring for composite web services. Specifically, in the stateful aspect, history-based pointcut specifies the pattern of interest within a range, while advice describes the associated action to manage the process if the specified pattern occurs. We also present its implementation based on finite state automata through runtime weaving mechanism. Our experiments indicate the proposed monitoring approach incurs minimal overhead.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371266,SWFilter: Semantic Web Services Filtering System.,"Web services search and discovery systems have received a great deal of attention recently. However, little attention has been given to a web services filtering system. In this paper, we propose a design and architecture of a semantic web services filtering system called SWFilter. SWFilter uses Prufer sequences transformed from web services and user queries. The filtering process is performed in a bottomup manner. Ontology information and compositions of web services are also considered in the filtering process.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371267,Automatically Determining Compatibility of Evolving Services.,"A major advantage of Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) is composition and coordination of loosely coupled services. Because the development lifecycles of services and clients are decoupled, multiple service versions have to be maintained to continue supporting older clients. Typically versions are managed within the SOA by updating service descriptions using conventions on version numbers and namespaces. In all cases, the compatibility among services description must be evaluated, which can be hard, error-prone and costly if performed manually, particularly for complex descriptions. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically determine when two service descriptions are backward compatible. We then describe a case study to illustrate how we leveraged version compatibility information in a SOA environment and present initial performance overheads of doing so. By automatically exploring compatibility information, a) service developers can assess the impact of proposed changes; b) proper versioning requirements can be put in client implementations guaranteeing that incompatibilities will not occur during run-time; and c) messages exchanged in the SOA can be validated to ensure that only expected messages or compatible ones are exchanged.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371268,Developing Process Mediator for Web Service Interactions.,"Web service interactions lie in the core of SOA. Due to the autonomy, heterogeneity and continuous evolution of Web services, mediators are usually needed to support service interactions to overcome possible mismatches that may exist among business processes. In this paper, we introduce a space-based architecture for process mediator which considers both control-flow and data-flow, present possible mismatch patterns, and suggest how they can be automatically mediated. Our work can be used to perform runtime mediation and thus to facilitate service interactions.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371269,A Consistency-Preserving Mechanism for Web Services Response Caching.,"Web services are rapidly emerging as a popular standard technology for sharing data and functionality among heterogeneous systems. Service providers and consumers are loosely coupled and distributed across the network, either within an organization or across organizational boundaries, and therefore, performance becomes a major concern in such a distributed environment. Furthermore, XML is widely used as message format for service providers and consumers in Web services environment. XML message packaging and parsing brings extra overhead to both ends. Web services response latency, as well as throughput, is becoming a bottleneck problem. In this paper, We propose a consistency-preserving mechanism for Web services response caching, which reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of service requests or responses, and accelerates the services response finally. It achieves this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect similarities with previous results. Experiments with an initial prototype called SigsitAcclerator indicate that our mechanism can lead to significant performance improvement over more straightforward techniques.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371270,Control Flow Intervention for Semantic Failure Handling during Composite Serice Execution.,"In this paper we report on our work towards a novel system that aims at the combination of classical failure handling methods for composite service execution and support for automatic handling of semantic application level failures. In particular, we formulate the notion of Control Flow Intervention; a generalization for handling those two types of failure categories. When combined with automatic service composition it constitutes an optimistic forward recovery method. The method adopts expressive semantic service annotations provided by OWL resp. OWL-S.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371271,A Tree-Based Method of Web Service Composition.,"Although service composition has received a great deal of attention and there are many solutions to the problem of composition, finding potential service compositions efficiently is still challenging because of the fact that the number of candidate services can be very large. In this paper, a tree-based method of web service composition is proposed, by which all potential candidate composite services that meet the user's request can be created. Moreover, these composite services are ordered according to the QoS attribute concerned by the user, so the user can find the best and arbitrary top-n composite services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371272,Specify and Compose Web Services by TLA.,"This paper introduces the concept of Temporal Logic of Actions (short for TLA), with which we can formally specify the behavior of a service, and compose Web services.

371273,Enhancing Security Modeling for Web Services Using Delegation and Pass-On.,"In recent years, the issues in web service security have been widely investigated and various security standards have been proposed. But most of these studies and standards focus on the access control policies for individual web services and do not consider the access issues in composed services. Consider a simple service chain where service s1 accesses s2, and s2, in turn, accesses service s3. The information returned from s3 to s2 may be used to compute some results that are further returned to s1. The current web service security framework does not provide any mechanisms to control such an information flow, and hence, sensitive information may be leaked to s1 without the consensus of s3.In this paper, we propose an enhanced security model to facilitate the control of information flow through service chains. It extends the basic security models by introducing the concepts of delegation and pass-on. Based on these concepts, new certificates, certificate chain, delegation and pass-on policies, and how they are used to control the information flow are discussed.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371274,Classification of SOA Contract Specification Languages.,"There are numerous existing notations and standards in the Web service community. These may be grouped broadly into three competing families, namely; Web Services, Semantic Web, and Electronic Business. Although the families are competing, we expect that applications will cut across them and there is a need to map from one to another and to analyze compatibility and other properties. Therefore we survey how they deal with different aspects. We then illustrate with examples, the aspects of contracts captured by one language from each of the three competing families in addition to WSDL, the core standard for Web services description. The result is a classification based on the aspects of computations: functionality, protocol, and for instance performance covered by the languages. The classification is used to identify similarities between semantic models and thus find potential mappings between the families. Furthermore, this gives a handle on analysis techniques that may apply to the aspects in a particular family.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371275,On Extending Semantic Matchmaking to Include Preconditions and Effects.,"Central to the notion of dynamic binding and loose coupling that underlie service-oriented architectures is dynamic service discovery. At the heart of most service discovery mechanisms is a matchmaking algorithm that matches a semantic query to a set of compatible web service advertisements. These advertisements also describe service semantics as a set of OWL-S terms. Most current matchmaking algorithms are based on semantic matching of input and output terms alone. However, a complete description of the service profile also includes preconditions and effects and in order to find a true match the matchmaker needs to match on these aspects of the advertisement as well. In this paper, we make the case for augmenting existing matchmaking algorithms with preconditions and effects in the context of Web Services. Further, we propose an algorithm for condition matching that is layered on the top of inputâ€“output term matching that overcomes the limitations of existing work. Although the problem of condition matching is NP-Complete, we can overcome this limitation by using a set of heuristics that gives us results in polynomial time. We also analyze complexity of the algorithm by comparing it with brute force approach of matching. We show that our algorithm yields results more efficiently than brute force matching but with the same accuracy.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371276,A Policy-Driven Distributed Framework for Monitoring Quality of Web Services.,"Quality of Service (QoS) characterizes the non-functional aspects of web service, which is the key factor for satisfying service users and has to be carefully considered in service oriented architecture. There has been a lot of works on QoS description and service selection by QoS information. However, two issues have not been substantially explored in QoS managementâ€”how to collect QoS information from running services, and how to dynamically adapt service provisioning with run-time QoS information. Moreover, current monitoring approaches are focused on monitoring the service interaction in a single domain, while cross-domain monitoring has not been studied yet. In this paper, we present a policy-driven monitoring framework for collecting QoS information and adapting service provisioning for cross-domain service interaction. The monitor is built on our distributed QoS registryâ€”Q-Peer. The monitor is user-centric, metric-oriented, feedback-enabled and loosely-coupled with service providers. Services are observed by capturing interaction messages, so the monitoring approach has no impact to service providers. The framework supports dynamic configuration of monitoring metrics for both single service and cross-domain composite service. It can be used as a reliable third-party QoS monitor for web services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371277,Building Profit-Aware Service-Oriented Business Applications.,"Service composition is becoming a prevalent way to building service-oriented business applications (SOBAs). In an open service environment, the profit of composition (PoC) is a primary concern of building such applications. How to improve the PoC is a significant issue in developing SOBAs but was largely overlooked by current research. Particularly, the modeling and prediction of PoC should play a key role to drive the composition process. In this paper, we focus on how to model and predict PoC in SOBAs. We regard the PoC of a composite service as a function of the quality of service (QoS) attributes, defined in the service level agreement (SLA) between the service and its external partners. Based on the PoC prediction approach, we further propose a profit-driven composition methodology to assist enterprises to make more profit in their SOBAs.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371278,A DDL-Based Model for Web Service Composition in Context-Aware Environment.,"Dynamic description logic (DDL) is among the few emerging service composition solutions through logical reasoning. To overcome low efficiency and lacking context-aware support of DDL reasoning, we propose a new DDL-based service composition model, which supports context-based service pre-filtering over DDL reasoning space. The pre-filtering runs under the BPEL workflow and a distributed reasoning algorithm need to reasoning different contexts after pre-filtering.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371279,SCWIM an Integrity Model for SOA Networks.,"Interest in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is rapidly increasing in the business world due to the many benefits it offers such as reliability, manageability, reusability, flexibility, efficiency, and interoperability. There are many security technologies and models being developed for SOA. They implement or encode specific aspects of authentication, authorization, encryption, trust, and access control respectively but none of them was entirely devoted to integrity. In this paper we propose Service Clark-Wilson Integrity Model (SCWIM), a top down integrity model for SOA capable of describing sufficient conditions to protect data integrity in any SOA implementation. Based on the original Clark-Wilson Integrity Model, our model can form the basis for system security audits and assist SOA architects in developing systems that protect data integrity, as well as providing guidance for evaluating existing SOA systems.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371280,Performance Comparison of Web Service Engines in PHP Java and C.,"PHP is well known as a programming language in the Web 2.0 era enabling agile server-side software development. It has officially supported SOAP messaging since version 5 through a C-based built-in library. In this paper we perform a thorough study of the capability of PHP as a web service engine in both qualitative and quantitative aspects while comparing it with other web service engines implemented in Java and C. We used Axis2 for this purpose as it is an open source web service engine whose implementation is available both in Java and C. We report that PHP as a web service engine performs competitively with Axis2 Java for web services involving small payloads, and greatly outperforms it for larger payloads by 5-17 times. As the authors expected, Axis2 C performs best, but the experimental results demonstrate that PHP performance is closer to Axis2 C with larger payloads. This performance difference comes from the fact that the SOAP engine within the PHP runtime is implemented in C with a monolithic architecture, whereas Axis2 uses a more modular architecture for the flexible insertation of handlers for an assorted set of WS-* standards, and also that Axis2 uses a different data binding mechanism known as ADB (Axis2 Data binding). This paper is the first attempt to compare web services engines implemented in PHP, Java and C, and the authors believe that this boosts the development of SOAP-based Web services in PHP by letting people know its decent performance score and high productivity characteristics.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371281,Creating Bioinformatics Semantic Web Services from Existing Web Services: A Real-World Application of SAWSDL.,"Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL) is a recently adopted W3C recommendation that provides a mechanism by which WSDL documents can reference external, domain-specific semantic models in order to provide concept-level interoperability of Web Services. Moby is an established protocol for providing semantic Web Services developed by the bioinformatics community: we use Moby to provide a grounding for a SAWSDL implementation in bioinformatics. Our software (Daggoo) allows users to create Moby-compliant semantic Web Services by simply adding SAWSDL markup to existing WSDL files. These new services are compatible with existing Moby services and client software. The Java software we present consists of a proxy servlet, a URI-resolution mechanism, and rule systems for converting back and forth between Moby and XML Schema data formats. As an early implementation of SAWSDL, Daggoo reveals shortcomings in the notation, and several additional technologies needed to achieve real-world semantic interoperability of WSDL-based services. Based on our experience, we suggest how to improve the semantic annotation mechanism, and how to reduce the programming burden for individual service providers. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of a semantically-enabled registry for services and data types in facilitating scientist-driven, rather than programmer-driven, Web service choreography.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371282,Autonomic Ranking and Selection of Web Services by Using Single Value Decomposition Technique.,"With the proliferation of Web services as a business solution to enterprise application integration, ranking and selecting the best Web services among the providers become an important factor in the success of the business solution. Quality of Service (QoS) determines the quality and usability of a service including its price, performance, reliability, integrity, accessibility, availability, interoperability, and security. Given a set of QoS attributes from a variety of sources, it is a challenge to sort through all of them and be able to get the best services that meet QoS requirement. In this paper, we describe a novel method by which Web services can be ranked and selected automatically based on a number of observed QoS parameters and feedback responses learned from prior knowledge. This new approach treats the observed Web services QoS attributes and target Web services relationship, represented by a matrix, as a statistical problem. Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique, and an user assisted weighting system, implicit higher order correlations among Web services and their associated QoS attributes are extracted and used to estimate the selection of recommended Web services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371283,Dynamic Exception Handling Based on Web Services and OPC XML-DA.,"Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) are widely used in process automation due to their fast and guarantee response time. However their programming and interfacing capacities are limited. In this paper we present a Surveillance software aimed to extend the range of actions available to deal with anomalous situations that are not critical in terms of time and to complement any actions implemented by other units in critical situations. The system combines the possibilities offered by standard OPC XML-DA, the integration capabilities provided by web services and rule-based engines with state-of-the-art technologies for communication such as e-mail, SMS, instant messaging or VoIP. Variables values are monitored by the component using OPC XML-DA and a set of previously defined rules that can trigger actions via web service invocations. These two characteristics allow creating a dynamic behaviour able to handle exceptions. In summary, this component extends control capacities and facilitates exception processing on PLC and NC",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371284,Development of Service Control Server for Web-Telecom Coordination Service.,"We propose the Service Control Technology for the Web-telecom coordination service, and we show our proposal effectiveness. In the NGN (Next-Generation Network), many new applications are expected using open network interfaces. In particular, we study the SDP (Service Delivery Platform) for coordinating existing Internet services and telecom services. In this paper, we propose the Service control technology, which handles common process required in the telecom trigger Web-telecom coordination service. Our method achieves improvement in usability of telecom user, reliability of the coordination service, and processing performance. We implement our method two types (Proxy type, Callable type) and measured processing performance. In comparison to related technologies, we show our method effectiveness.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371285,Mining the Web of Trust for Web Services Selection.,"Trust and reputation mechanisms offer a promising way to solve the web services selection problem. Currently, many researches on this topic focus on collecting, storing and aggregating feedbacks which can be execution data from monitoring web services or user ratings reported by service consumers for web services evaluation. However, besides considering the evaluation methods, the reliability of feedbacks becomes equally crucial. It is pointed out that the accuracy of a web service's reputation evaluation will be reduced as unreliable feedbacks are used. Therefore, the elicitation of trusted feedbacks and feedbackers becomes very important. In this paper, we managed to elicit trusted users in our service registry through building and maintaining a ""Web of Trust"". We mined this web of trust by our proposed algorithm which is based on the Kalman Filter Algorithm and analyzed the trustworthiness for each user. Feedbacks reported by trusted users then should be considered more reliable than others to ultimately facilitate the web services selection process.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371286,Towards Scalable Web Service Composition with Partial Matches.,"We investigate scalable algorithms for automated composition (WSC) of Semantic Web Services. Our notion of WSC is very general: the composition semantics includes background knowledge and we use the most general notion of matching, partial matches, where several web services can cooperate, each covering only a part of a requirement. Unsurprisingly, automatic composition in this setting is very hard. We identify a special case with simpler semantics, which covers many relevant scenarios. We develop a composition tool for this special case. Our goal is to achieve scalability: we overcome large search spaces by guiding the search using heuristic techniques. The computed solutions are optimal up to a constant factor. We test our approach on a simple, yet powerful real world use-case; the initial results attest the potential of the approach.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371287,Service Level Agreement Based Grid Scheduling.,"In order to co-ordinate multiple resource providers in grid environment to meet a common objective, support for negotiation is needed to establish a contract between the user and the resource providers that clearly states the QoS required, restrictions on resource utilization and penalties during violation of the objective. Strength of the negotiation process mainly depends on the selection of resources for negotiation. Currently, no grid meta scheduler supports SLA negotiation. We propose a deviation based resource ordering algorithm (DRS) that orders and selects the resources for negotiation based on their deviation value computed from the parameters in the job request against their current availability in the resources. Also, we propose mutual agreement protocol (MAP) to negotiate with resources in order to get their commitment against the job request. We simulate this negotiation process and compare it against gridway meta scheduler that shows improved performance in terms of average SLA creation time, success rate and throughput.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371288,Approaches to Improving Reliability in e-Engineering Framework.,"In order to improve productivity and quality of the products, there are many efforts to integrate and automate design/analysis processes based on various distributed engineering resources. KIMM (Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials) constructed SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)-based e-Engineering framework for flexible integration and automation of the engineering processes on the Web services environment. However, guaranteeing reliability in the engineering process is one of the new problems that must be solved in the e-Engineering framework. This paper presents two approaches to handle various exceptions that happen in the middle of the execution of the process. One is to introduce recovery activities into the engineering process modeling to handle exceptions caused by failures of the engineering resources; the other is to use log-based recovery techniques to recover from the system exceptions such as network failures or system crashes.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371289,An Efficient Syntactic Web Service Composition Algorithm Based on the Planning Graph Model.,"In this paper, we have studied a common Web service composition problem, the syntactic matching problem, where the output parameters of a Web service can be used as the input parameters of another Web service. Many automatic Web service composition algorithms based on AI planning techniques have been proposed. However, most of them do not scale well when the number of Web services increases, or may miss finding a solution even if one exists. The planning graph, another AI planning technique, provides a unique search space. We have found that when we model the Web service composition problem as a planning graph, it actually provides a trivial solution to the problem. Instead of following the usual way to find a solution by a backward search, we put our efforts into removing the redundant Web services contained in the planning graph. Our approach can find a solution in polynomial time, but with possible redundant Web services. We have tested our algorithms on the data set used in ICEBEâ€™05 and compared our results with existing methods.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371290,Redundant-Free Web Services Composition Based on a Two-Phase Algorithm.,"Web services composition search systems have received a great deal of attention recently. However, current solutions have limitations of inefficiency and including redundant web services in the results. In this paper, we proposed a redundant-free web services composition search based on a two phase algorithm. In the forward phase, the candidate composition will be found efficiently by searching the Link Index. In the backward phase, redundant-free web services compositions are generated from the candidate composition by using the concepts of tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the performance benefits of our proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art composition approaches.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371291,Composing Adaptive Web Services on COTS Middleware.,"Composing adaptive and self-managing Web services needs plug-and-play architecture so that the deployment of control components does not require changes made to the Web services and the host middleware platforms. This is especially challenging for Web services running on COTS middleware platforms, such as Microsoft .Net. In this paper, we propose an architectural solution that introduces a management proxy between adaptive control components and Web services. The management proxy can be customized and seamlessly integrated with a COTS middleware platform by leveraging the existing middleware mechanisms. This solution enables dynamically composing adaptive Webservices on COTS middleware without stopping its services. We demonstrate this architecture by a realistic Web service application built on .Net Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). The performance overhead incurred by this architecture is measured, and the results validate that our solution is efficient in terms of performance and flexibility.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371292,An Approach to Check Choreography with Channel Passing in WS-CDL.,"Channel passing mechanisms enable dynamically determining destinations of message transferring. WS-CDL, a language developed by W3C for the specification of Web services choreographies, adopts channel passing to support dynamic Web services composition. A choreography can be projected into individual services or orchestration skeletons. It is a challenge to ensure the services generated from a choreography always have sufficient and correct channels to complete their collaboration. In fact, WS-CDL is not ready for rigorous validation and implementation with respect to channel passing, since it provides no structure for specifying explicitly which role should firstly initialize which channel variable. Here we propose an algorithm to uncover these implicit assumptions, that is implemented as an extension to Pi4SOA. With the help of the algorithm, some existing methods for verification and implementation can be applied on choreographies written in WS-CDL. In addition, we propose an approach to detect design defects in choreographies, and show how a defect is found from the main sample choreography in WS-CDL Primer. It seems that choreographies with channel passing are error prone. Methods and tools are necessary to support designers in this field. Also, we suggest improving the situation by adding a syntactical construct to WS-CDL.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371293,Web Services Discovery Based on Latent Semantic Approach.,"With an ever-increasing number of Web services being available, finding desired Web service is crucial for service users. Current keyword search and most existing approaches are inefficient in two main aspects: poor scalability and lack of semantics. Firstly, users are overwhelmed by the huge number of irrelevant services returned. Secondly, the intentions of users and the semantics in Web services are ignored. Inspired by the success of the Divide and Conquer approach used to handle the complex information decomposition, we use a novel approach to partition a large set of search results into a set of smaller groups by employing a clustering approach. Then we utilize Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to capture the main semantics hidden behind the words in a query and the descriptions in the services, so that service matching can be carried out at the concept level. We report here on the preliminary experimental evaluation that shows improvements overall precision.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371294,A Model-Driven Framework for Enabling Self-Service Configuration of Business Services.,"In seeking more profits, many business service providers have turned their attention to the technologies that can enable the delivery and operations of the network-delivered business services more efficiently and highly automated. To that end, many service providers have adopted the shared service model where the service offerings are shared across multiple customers to reduce the costs associated with the services' delivery. One key challenge for service providers is how to configure various parameters and options of the services with highly automated and self-service modes to meet the customers' diverse requirements with minimized costs. Therefore, effective service configuration lifecycle management technologies and approaches have become the differentiations of successful service providers. In this paper, we propose a common service configuration framework as one of the infrastructure features of the service operation platform based on the shared service model to ease and unify the configuration lifecycle across service offerings. In this framework, we adopt the model-driven technology to automate the service configuration lifecycle. This novel approach combines the wizard technology and rule-based validation technology to enable the service customers to perform self-service configuration. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework is discussed at the end of this paper.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371295,Choreography = Orchestration with Scripts + Conversations.,"The specification, design and implementation of web service applications need to address three major aspects: Orchestration of Services, Conversation and Choreography. In distributed computing, abstractions such as scripts have been used to abstract patterns of communication hiding low level details. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach of integrating orchestration with scripting to depict a pattern of communication or conversations among various agents.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371296,Dynamic Availability Estimation for Service Selection Based on Status Identification.,"With the popularity of Service-Oriented Computing, how to construct highly available service-oriented applications is becoming a hot topic in both the research and industry communities. As a fundamental problem in dynamic service selection, availability estimation is challenging because of the dynamic nature of web services. To grasp the dynamic nature of web services, we set up an experimental environment for collecting runtime information of webservices. Based on the collected runtime information, we identify several characteristics of service failures and successes, and further define three typical service runtime statuses. Based on these statuses, we propose a novel approach to dynamic availability estimation, which is called Status Identification based Availability Estimation for Service Selection (SIBE). To evaluate our approach, we compare SIBE with other approaches in an experiment of dynamic service selection onthe Internet. Experimental results show that SIBE can efficiently improve the success rate of selecting available services.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371297,Change Sequence Mining for Context Aware Service Process Customization.,"Service process usually needs to be changed during reuse because of the change of context. These change mapping relations provide additional information to help users customize service processes. In this paper, we present a mining approach to mining process change sequences based on different context and finding the best sequence to tailor the base process.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371298,Semantic and Syntactic Data Flow in Web Service Composition.,"Automation of Web service composition is one of the most interesting challenges facing the Service Oriented Computing today. From this challenge, many issues such as control flow, data flow, verification, execution monitoring, or recovery actions (e.g., compensation) follows. In this paper we focus on automated data flow in Web service composition. The semantic Web, as an evolving extension of the current Web, seems a key initiative to overcome the latter issue. However, even if some approaches focus on discovering potential semantic connections between Web services, few or none of these tackle implementations issues related to XML messages management at syntactic level. In this direction we present an approach for performing automated data flow in Web service composition by i) exploiting semantic matchmaking between Web service parameters (i.e., outputs and inputs) to enable their connection and interaction, and ii) adapting XML database solutions, specifically XML Schema mapping, to perform syntactic data transformation and integration of exchanged messages. Our system is implemented and interacting with Web services dedicated on a Telecom scenario. The preliminary evaluation results showed not only high efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach but also complementarity of the semantic matchmaking and syntactic mapping to achieving data flow in Web service composition.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371299,Services Characterization with Statistical Study on Existing Web Services.,Most of the current semantic representation methods for service capabilities are usually based on top-down methodology. We aim to develop services characterization methods with statistical study on existing web services and to improve services capability representation with bottom-up software services comprehension. Two services characterization methods are proposed in our work: quantitative statistical study which used for probing the distribution of main objects in web services and relational statistical study which used for clustering actions or contents and measuring the similarity of web services. A statistical relational model is proposed for mining and recognizing the patterns of services.,2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371300,Dynamic Thread Count Adaptation for Multiple Services in SMP Environments.,"We propose a dynamic mechanism, thread count adaptation, that adjusts the thread counts that are allocated to services for adapting to CPU requirement variations in SMP environments. Our goal is to increase the maximum throughput available on a system that has multiple dynamic content services while meeting different service time criteria for these services in dynamic workloads. Our challenge is to significantly improve response times for dynamic content on a busy well-tuned thread-pool-based system without prioritizing any specific services. Our experiments demonstrate that a prototype using our approach on J2EE middleware quickly (around every 20 ms) adjusted the thread counts for the services and that it improved the average 90th-percentile response times by up to 27% (and 22% on average) for the SPECj AppServer2004 benchmark.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371301,WS-CCDL: A Framework for Web Service Collaborative Context Definition Language for Dynamic Collaborations.,"Dynamic collaborations involve contributed resources across the organisational boundaries that are subjected to different set of policies. The management of such resources for dynamic collaborations including negotiation, validation, instantiation and termination is difficult. Existing approaches for collaborations using Web Services such as WSLA are designed to deal with scenarios involving two parties: a service provider and a service consumer. These approaches do not scale well to multiparty nature of dynamic collaborations. To address this problem, we propose a framework for a language called Web Service Collaborative Context Definition Language for dynamic collaborations. The language itself has been defined using XML Schema and has been implemented in a dynamic collaboration platform.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371302,Coding-Free Model-Driven Enablement Framework and Engineering Practices of a Context-Aware SOA Modeling Environment.,"The rapid adoption of Model-Driven Design (MDD) methodology in SOA-based solution design requires an adaptive tooling environment that can systematically improve designers' productivity. Ideally, the environment should be flexible enough to both handle frequently changing requirements and support new features without intensive coding efforts. In this paper, we provide a coding-free enablement framework to realize such extensible tooling environments based on a mathematical abstraction of key models in SOA solution design using graph theory definition. This abstraction formalizes the SOA modeling logic and semantics, and also guides the implementation of an extensible and customizable tooling environment. As a case study, we illustrate how our framework is able to transform the development style from Java programming to text editing through our implementation of a UML 2.0 based SOA modeling environment using IBMâ€™s Rational Software Architect (RSA) development platform.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371304,A Theory of Role Composition.,"We study the access control integration problem for web services. Organizations frequently use many services, each with its own access control policies, which must interoperate while maintaining secure access to information. The integration problem is to take the set of such services and to find a globally consistent access control policy that ensures that the system composed from the services does not have any authorization failures or information disclosures. We give a sound and complete algorithm for access control integration by reducing the problem to Boolean constraint solving. We have implemented RoleMatcher, a tool to infer global role-based access control schemas for a set of services, and show on examples that it can quickly infer global roles for composed systems, or determine the absence of a globally consistent role schema.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371305,Using User Interface Design to Enhance Service Identification.,"User Interface (UI) design is an integral part of the software design process. The UI design not only outlines the look and feel of the system, but also helps in flushing out the requirementsâ€”by identifying what data is visible to and processed by different users. However, in any SOA methodology, UI design is typically considered out of scope. In this paper, we highlight the importance of UI design specification in the SOA landscape, from a service- identification perspective. Service identification, which is a key activity in any SOA-based development, involves specification of business requirements as a set of granular service definitions. We propose an approach for harvesting the UI design specification to define service requirements for the intended system; more specifically in terms of information and business service requirements. Our approach consists of the following steps: (1) capture user interface design in a format amenable to automated analysis, with appropriate references to data and process models, (2) identify requirements for information services from data that is displayed in the user interface, and (3) identify business service requirements from the UI navigation flow and the links between the UI and the business process model. To illustrate our approach, we present a case study using the Amazon Associate Web Services. The study demonstrates how the use of UI designs can lead to better service identification. The proposed approach can complement any existing SOA methodology that follows a top-down approach to identify services",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371306,Mobile Services Business and Technology Trends.,"Thanks to the advent of smart devices and the emergence of 3G/4G wireless technologies, services over mobile phones are becoming in many respects similar to those available over the PC based internet. Indeed mobile web-based services, such as search, maps, presence, messaging, emails, productivity, social networking, and entertainment are becoming available in high-end phones from several device manufacturers. Mobile computing, however, promises richer applications and services based on location and context. Web technologies are being adapted and extended to support emerging mobile internet services. However, location based mobile services present new significant challenges in terms of implementation and management complexity. In this presentation we will discuss the business trends of mobile services.

This paper proposes a process algebra called PPA (Priced Process Algebra) basing on CCS (Calculus of Communicating Systems) [1]. We discuss the syntax and semantics of PPA extended with priced information and provide an algorithm to support web services composition with optimal cost.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371309,Control Flow Analysis and Coverage Driven Testing for Web Services.,"In this paper, we describe an approach to discover the control flow graph of web services for web services analysis, verification, and testing. For this purpose, three novel methods are proposed. First, we introduce a domain independent RDF Schemas for concise resource oriented functional specification of web services operations. Secondly, we describe the use of RDF entailment to accurately derive the control flow from the functional specifications. We developed a transformation from RDF graph to SPARQL query to facilitate the RDF entailment which offers flexibility and extensibility over the direct graph matching approach. The third is a linkage based web services modeling and analysis framework, within which we apply an improved Google PageRank algorithm to efficiently calculate test coverage potential using the derived control flow. We justify that the proposed linkage based web services modeling and analysis framework is particularly suitable for testing web services. A prototype of the proposed methods has been implemented and tested on some standard based web services. Experimental results show that the control flow analysis is quite efficient and accurate, and the coverage based test results of the proposed approach are very promising.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371310,Tool Support for Safety Analysis of Service Composition and Deployment Models.,"This paper reports on an implementation for tool support of model-checking collaborating service compositions with deployment configurations under resource constraints.The implementation accepts UML Deployment Diagrams with an applied service deployment profile and one or more WS-BPEL orchestrations that are assigned to web servlets and servers in this deployment. Using model-checking techniques the tool can determine whether the configuration of deadlock-free service orchestration processes introduce deadlock scenarios when combined with resource constraints of a deployment environment. The implementation is built upon a tool suite, called WSEngineer, which is aimed at assisting service engineers in constructing and testing various aspects of a service engineering approach, including orchestration,choreography and deployment artifacts. The tool integrates as a plug-in for Eclipse, alongside the IBM Rational Software Architect tool suite and others. A case study based upon a complex service grid solution, for analyzing chemical markup patterns, is used to demonstrate the accessible and practical nature of thesolution.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371311,Communication over IP Based on Web Services.,"In this paper, we study the communication over IP based on web services. We describe the service-oriented communication framework of WIP, Web Services Initiation Protocol, and focus on its web centric networking infrastructure. In our approach, WIP endpoints are exposed as resources on the Web, publishable by their UDDI service registries. They can be searched and discovered by regular web search engines, e.g. Google, upon which they can be networked and linked for scalable and distributed communication over IP. In our approach, the WIP endpoint is a web services based communication endpoint for communication over IP. It is also a service endpoint for software-as-a-service (SaaS) that can integrate, marshup, and enable advanced SaaS applications in communication. Moreover, we introduce the presence aware communication framework in WIP utilizing its extensible and service-oriented infrastructure. An advanced WIP communication system prototype has been implemented. It supports the advanced features described in this paper, including distributed communication, networking, security, presence, etc. Experimental results are presented, and the proposed approach and methods are validated.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371312,A Fast Method to Find Solution for Service Composition.,"Web service has emerged as a new solution for enterprise application integration. Automatic service composite algorithm is to build a composite service for user's request or complex business requirement. Most former work uses the dependence among services, however the relationship is often complicated and the composition algorithm is time consuming. This paper proposes a type based service composition algorithm, which can calculate a feasible solution in linear time. We conduct a series of experiments with real dataset and generated data. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371313,Mashup Advisor: A Recommendation Tool for Mashup Development.,"Mashup editors, like Yahoo Pipes and IBM Lotus Mashup Maker, allow non-programmer end-users to â€œmash-upâ€ù information sources and services to meet their information needs. However, with the increasing number of services, information sources and complex operations like filtering and joining, even an easy to use editor is not sufficient. MashupAdvisor aims to assist mashup creators to build higher quality mashups in less time. Based on the current state of a mashup, the MashupAdvisor quietly suggests outputs (goals) that the user might want to include in the final mashup. MashupAdvisor exploits a repository of mashups to estimate the popularity of specific outputs, and makes suggestions using the conditional probability thatan output will be included, given the current state of the mashup. When a suggestion is accepted, MashupAdvisor uses a semantic matching algorithm and a metric planner to modify the mashup to produce the suggested output. Our prototype was implemented on top of IBM Lotus MashupMaker and our initial results show that it is effective.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371314,Exploiting Independence in Design of Web Service Composition.,"Communications among web services are asynchronous. Asynchronous models of service compositions face the problem that the performance of verification is bring down with states explosion. We describe an approach, which utilize the interaction-independence of component services in the composition and forms all component services into different groups. Preliminary experiment results show that the verification of service compositions upon these groups can decrease the size of exploration states and hence improve the performance.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371315,Communications Semantics for WSBPEL Processes.,"WSBPEL opens up the possibility of applying arange of formal techniques to the verification of Webservice behaviors from two points of view: constraints between activities within the same process and dependencies between activities of different processes. In a previous work, we have described an approach for the verification of Web service compositions defined by a set of BPEL processes. The key aspect of such a verification task is the model adopted for representing the communications among the services participating to the composition. In this paper, we propose to extend this approach to handle dependencies between activities of different process orchestrations through message exchanges. Our aim is to enable supporting models of service choreography with multiple interacting Web services compositions, from the perspective of a collaborative distributed composition development environment. The process of behavior analysis moves from a single local process to that of modelling and analyzing the behavior of multiple processes across composition domains.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371316,A User-Oriented Approach to Automated Service Composition.,"In the past a few years, the Web has undergone a tremendous change towards a highly user-centric environment. Millions of users can participate and collaborate for their own interests and benefits. Service Oriented Computing and web services have created great potential opportunities for the users to build their own applications. Then, it is a pressing issue that, the users can compose services without too complex tasks and efforts. In this paper, we introduce a user-oriented approach which aims to simplify service composition. We leverage the plentiful information residing in service tags, both from service descriptions (such as WSDL) and the annotations tagged by users. Employing some mining algorithms, a Direct Acyclic Graph is built up to represent potential composition opportunities. With a simple and intuitive search, it allows users to explore the space of potentially composable services and achieve service composition in a heuristic manner. We have developed a composition advisor to provide recommendations guiding and assisting the users. It also lets the users discover and make use of services without having to understand too many details of individual candidate services. To enable the users to accomplish service composition in a more interactive access channel, we finally provide a user-friendly prototype based on web browsers. It undoubtedly reduces the complexity and lowers the entry barrier for the users, and makes them better play their role in the Service-Oriented Web Environment.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371317,Ontology-Based Test Modeling and Partition Testing of Web Services.,"Testing is useful to establish trust between service providers and clients. To test the service-oriented applications, automated and specification-based test generation and test collaboration are necessary. The paper proposes an ontology-based approach for Web Services (WS) testing. A Test Ontology Model (TOM) is defined to specify the test concepts, relationships, and semantics from two aspects: test design (such as test data, test behavior, and test cases) and test execution (such as test plan, schedule and configuration). The TOM specification using OWL (Web Ontology Language) can serve as test contracts among test components. Based on the WS semantic specification in OWL-S, the paper discusses the techniques to generate the sub-domains for input partition testing. Data pools are established for each parameter of the specified service. Data partitions are derived by class property and relationship analysis. Completeness and consistency (C&C) checking can be performed on the data partitions and data values, both within the TOM and against the OWL-S, by ontology class computation and reasoning. A prototype tool is implemented to support OWL-S analysis, test ontology generation and C&C checking.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371318,A Monitoring Framework of WS-Resource Properties in WS-GRAM.,"Grid computing has been widely spread in pragmatic areas and scientific research areas in order to achieve more powerful computation than ordinary computation by single computer. Globus Toolkit4 (GT4), which has been the de facto standard middleware in Grid, gives to us many chances of submitting jobs, especially using WSRF technologies. However, in case of cluster type grid using GT4, rules for job execution depend on a local scheduler (LS) which interacts with WS-GRAM in GT4, so that clients can not reflect their own rules to behaviors in each worker node. In this paper, we formulate those potential problems and solutions based on our proposed architecture in, whose main feature is to monitor Resource Property (RP) in WS-GRAM and notify its status to worker nodes. Then we describe how to implement a mechanism for monitoring RP in WS-GRAM to achieve the transparent delivery of client's rules to worker nodes. Our experimental results show that our proposed architecture can be incorporated in WS-GRAM without difficulty.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Following this tendency, this work presents a dependable (i.e., intrusion-tolerant) infrastructure for cooperative web services coordination that is based on the tuple space coordination model. This infrastructure provides decoupled communication and implements several security mechanisms that allow reliable coordination even in presence of malicious components.This work also investigates the costs related to the use of this infrastructure and possible web service applications that can benefit from it.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

In this paper, we argue that the deployment of SOA in an organization should be business domain-specific, and propose an approach called CAFISE-S, which introduces SOA into scientific information integration from a business view-aspect. Business service is put forward as basic elements in CAFISE-S to model business context and IT services coherently in a semantic way. Based on business service, CAFISE-S provides a business domain-specific modeling method for specification of information services, and then supports business-oriented publication, management and usage of information services. The implementation of CAFISE-S platform and an application of CAFISE-S in a real-world project of scientific information integration are also presented in this paper.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371321,Toward a Model-Based Approach to Dynamic Adaptation of Composite Services.,"Facing changing environments and evolving business rules, composite services ought to be adaptable, even at run-time. Existing mainstream service composition languages and execution engines exhibit insufficient support for variability and adaptability to cater for dynamic changes. Research efforts have been put on the extension of the languages and argumentation of the engines. However, how to ensure the correctness for the adaptation of a running composite service instance and minimize unnecessary re-execution of component services remains a challenge. To address this problem, we propose a model-based approach that allows run-time adaptation of composite services. It is based on an instance transfer mechanism that transfers an active instance of the old service composition schema to a appropriate state of the new schema. Algorithms are proposed to find the appropriate destination states of the transformation. After the migration, the suspended instances can resume their execution according to the new schema. An example based on a FindRoute composite service is also included.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371322,Emergency Response Framework for Aviation XML Services on MANET.,"A XML service is a software component that supports interoperable application-to-application interaction over a network. Each service makes its functionality available through well-defined or standardized XML interfaces. Aviation XML services refer to the services that make operating an airplane in air and on ground possible. In this paper, we present an emergency response framework to organize the aviation XML services to work cooperatively on mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). A MANET is defined as a self-organized and rapidly deployed network of XML services in order to exchange information without using any pre-existing fixed network infrastructure. Note that the framework does not have to be limited to the aviation sector. The methodology can also be adopted into other MANET computing scenarios including: natural disaster communications (e.g., tsunami, earthquakes), emergency relief scenarios, car-based networks, and the provision of wireless connectivity in remote areas.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371323,A QoS-Oriented Reconfigurable Middleware for Self-Healing Web Services.,"Maintaining the Quality of Service (QoS) is important for self-healing web service-based distributed interactive applications. It requires the ability to deal with permanently changing constraints both at the communication and the execution levels. Preventing or repairing QoS degradation also requires the capacity of identifying its possible or actual sources and the capacity of reconfiguration decision and enforcement. Dealing with these issues is especially challenging for web services since the self-healing solution has to preserve the dynamic composition property and to be seamless for the service requesters, while being always usable under the different deployment constraints. In this paper, we present a self-healing middleware framework able to provide the self-healing properties for QoS management in web service-based distributed interactive applications. The framework implementation has been achieved in the context of the WS-DIAMOND project. It covers the whole cycle of adaptation management including monitoring and analysis of QoS values, and substitution-based reconfiguration.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371324,A Rule-Based Approach for Availability of Web Service.,"Sustainable success of service oriented applications relies on capabilities to manage possible service failures. To substitute a failed service with some other equivalent service is unavoidable in recovering a suspended application due to failure of a constituent service. In this paper, we report a rule based approach to Web service substitution in order to secure availability of services. Availability provides delivery assurance for each Web service so that Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages cannot be lost undetectably, especially in a Web service composition. The rules are written in Semantic Web Rule Language. The rules are a formal representation of a categorization-based scheme to identify exchangeable Web services. This scheme not only tackles the issue of heterogeneity of domain ontology in describing the Web services, it also adapts itself by learning newly discovered ontology instances. A technical framework of Web service substitution using rule based deduction is demonstrated. Experiments on service substitution based on the proposed framework achieve a best precision of 85%.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371325,New Broadcasting System Combined with Radio Broadcasting and WWW.,"Despite the benefits those communities FM radio broadcasting services provide to their listeners, more than half of the community stations in Japan are struggling financially. This situation has arisen because the Internet has attracted advertising revenue away from radio broadcasting channels. One way to revive local FM radio broadcasting is by adding new representation function to radio signals. It is designed for many listeners to share the same information simultaneously. On the other hand, while the Web provides a variety of content, its ability to broadcast is inferior to that of TV or radio broadcasting. Combining radio broadcasting and the WWW provides a new broadcasting media. The control signals used for accessing the Web are put onto radio sound by using Acoustic OFDM technology. We developed and evaluated such a broadcasting system.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371326,Automatic Service Composition Based on Enhanced Service Dependency Graph.,"Service dependency graph (SDG) is an AND/OR graph showing input output dependencies among service operations. As dependencies in an SDG are indirectly expressed by reasoning on data models used by service interface definitions, their re-usability and expressiveness are limited. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of service dependency graph, namely SDG+. SDG+ enhances SDG with explicit dependency declaration, which expresses dependencies directly with static explicit declarations. Based on SDG+, we developed our automatic service composition algorithm for WS-Challenge 2007, which wins the championship of composition efficiency in the competition.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371327,Multimedia Content Provisioning Using Service Oriented Architectures.,"Today, multimedia system are still widely realized as monolithic systems. But building such applications using Service-Oriented Architectures â€” especially for the Processing and Delivery of continous Multimedia data streamsâ€” has been a controversial topic since years. As a result, applications in the multimedia domain cannot yet benefit from Web service architectures. Thus, building and maintaining large-scale multimedia applications remains a difficult, costly, time-consuming and challenging problem. In this paper we present our approach for building large scale multimedia systems and compare it with the current state of the art, concentrating on the selection and validation of multimedia service composition.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371328,Adaptive Quality Recommendation Mechanism for Software Service Provisioning.,"In this paper, we propose an adaptive quality recommendation mechanism to help software service providers understand the dynamism of quality demand from the majority of requesters accurately. The unique feature of our approach is that based on the intra-cluster proximity index (called the icp-index) that we propose, the granularity of service clustering can be adjusted dynamically to meet the wide variation of service providers who want to target their services to different groups of clients. Experiments show that our approach is more accurate and flexible to identify the need of service quality of requesters than existing solutions such as simple averaging, minimum-maximum-mean, or traditional interval-range data clustering.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

We present performance evaluation of the m-Tableaux optimisation strategies which clearly demonstrate its operational feasibility on a mobile device.,2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371330,High-Performance XML Parsing and Validation with Permutation Phrase Grammar Parsers.,"The extensibility, flexibility, expressiveness, and platform-neutrality of XML delivers key advantages for interoperability. The interoperability of XML Web services often comes at the price of reduced efficiency of message composition, transfer, and parsing compared to simple binary protocols. This paper presents a high-performance XML parsing and validation technique that is time and space optimal. A schema-specific parsing method is developed that uses a two-stack push-down automaton (PDA) for single-pass parsing and validation without backtracking. The schema validity constraints are packed in a compact parsing table derived from a permutation phrase grammar. This approach reduces both the space and time requirements of XML parsing and validation. By contrast, other XML schema-specific parsing methods trade efficiency for space (larger code and/or data size) or trade space for efficiency (backtracking). Performance results show that the method is significantly faster than traditional validating and non-validating XML parsers.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371331,Interoperability among Service Registry Implementations: Is UDDI Standard Enough?,"The aim of this paper is to reveal some intrinsic disadvantages of the current version of UDDI standard, which create problems in using it as a standard for private, in-house storage of enterprise services. Examples include: access control mechanisms in UDDI, limited rich queries capability, inappropriate mapping of webservice artifacts into UDDI entities, impossibility of managing classification system values, etc. For each disadvantage we consider, we give an illustrative example of its impact in an enterprise service environment. To overcome these disadvantages, someservice registry implementations, based on UDDI introduce proprietary extensions to the standard, or embed additional programmatic logic in their client modules of UDDI, which decreases interoperability between them.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371332,Facilitating Dynamic Collaborations with eContract Services.,"Electronic Contract (eContract) has been recognized as a good combination of technical specification and legal documentation for establishing and regulating virtual organizations built for dynamic collaborations. This paper presents a design and implementation of an eContract service with an aim of providing a trusted collaboration platform for collaborators. The implemented service uses web services technologies to facilitate its collaborators not only to contribute resources in an eContract, but also to negotiate and instantiate them through eContract. This paper describes the interface and protocols for the eContract service. The architecture, interface and protocols designed for the service are demonstrated using an example of providing universal connectivity service for a telepresence application in the context of eResearch domain.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371333,Algorithm for Extrapolating Blogger's Interests through Library Classification Systems.,"All words are used in books, in which each are organized into a category through a library classification system. Therefore, words used by bloggers are also written in books, which in turn are categorized into specific categories. If a blogger uses a particular word often, we can anticipate that the blogger will have interest areas coinciding with the related book categories. This paper suggests that bloggersâ€™ interests can be known through extracting keywords from blog entry titles and using book classification schemes. Because there were instances in which the keywords alone did not provide adequate information, the Naver (Korean search engine) Related Keywords Search function was used because of its collective intelligence properties. During the experiment, test subjects picked the blogs and entry titles, which were analyzed using the 'Naver OpenAPI'. The results show that it is possible to know a blogger's interests using blog entry titles and book classifications.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Also discuss the possible ecosystem based on this approach, and the business model that could probably emerge using such a model. In this architecture, we explore the benefits of the Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework for providing us with an ideal service execution platform on the servers, with subscriber client devices on the Internet deploying their services dynamically on them. With a cluster of such networks, we form a distributed communication network for different regions of deployment, with an interaction model between them.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

371338,Automated Web Service Composition Using Extended Representation of Planning Domain.,"WS are distributed software components that can be exposed and invoked over the Internet using standard protocols. They communicate with their clients and with other WS by sending XML based messages over the Internet. AI planning techniques can help solving the composition of WS problem. In fact, services can be modelled as actions and the business process as planning to connect the WS. The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the model of actions to handle the creation or elimination of objects as effects of actions. This contribution allows us to answer to new and more expressive requests, called implicit requests, in which goals may contain objects that have been generated by the plan.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371339,Identifying Security Aspects in Web-Based Federations.,"Today's web applications and their respective business processes reside under the control of different organizations. Establishing federations between these organizations, i.e. bringing these business processes together by transcending organizational and security borders, raises a new class of security questions concerning the management of trust relationships between the autonomous bodies that wish to work together. Based on the WebComposition Architecture Model we provide a modeling approach for federated Web applications. In this paper we present a methodology for formalizing these models using the Ambient Calculus for use in further computation. Based on the results we help the users to identify and detect security related aspects in Web-based federations.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

Video, the 2nd largest U.S. video sharing site, to understand its nature and the impact on online video data center design. We discovered interesting statistical properties on both static and temporal dimensions of the workload; they include file duration and popularity distributions, arrival rate dynamics and predictability, and workload stationarity and burstiness. Complemented with queueing-theoretic techniques, we extended our understanding on the measurement data with a virtual data center design assuming the same workload as measured, which reveals results regarding the impact of workload arrival distribution, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and workload scheduling schemes on the design and operations of such large-scale video distribution systems.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371342,A Temporal Data-Mining Approach for Discovering End-to-End Transaction Flows.,"Effective management of Web Services systems relies on accurate understanding of end-to-end transaction flows, which may change over time as the service composition evolves. This work takes a data mining approach to automatically recovering end-to-end transaction flows from (potentially obscure) monitoring events produced by monitoring tools. We classify the caller-callee relationships among monitoring events into three categories(identity, direct-invoke, and cascaded-invoke), and propose unsupervised learning algorithms to generate rules for each type of relationship. The key idea is to leverage the temporal information available in the monitoring data and extract patterns that have statistical significance. By piecing together the caller-callee relationships a teach step along the invocation path, we can recover the end-to-end flow for every executed transaction. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithms outperform human experts in terms of solution quality, scale well with the data size, and are robust against noises in monitoring data.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,
371343,Orchestrating caGrid Services in Taverna.,"caBIGâ„¢ (the cancer Biomedical Informatics Gridâ„¢) is an open-source, open-access information network enabling cancer researchers to share tools, data, applications, and technologies. caGrid is the underlying service-based grid software infrastructure for caBIG, integrating distributed data and analytic resources into a virtual collaborative platform for cancer research. Within caGrid, many cancer-related data analysis and aggregation tasks can make use of ""canned"" sets of service invocations, or workflows. As a result, there is a need to orchestrate the invocation of caGrid services through the use of both a workflow language and tooling. In this paper, we first explain why we select Taverna as a candidate for workflow authoring and invocation. We then review the development of Taverna plug-ins in general, and describe how we extend Taverna to use caGrid services. We then detail a real-world example and the lessons learned from our research. Finally we conclude with a summary and a description of potential next steps.",2008,,,,,ICWS,,,

1003263,Matchmaking for Business Processes Based on Choreographies.,"Web services have a potential to enhance B2B e-commerceover the Internet by allowing companies andorganizations to publish their business processes on servicedirectories where potential trading partners canfind them. This can give rise to new business paradigmsbased on ad-hoc trading relations as companies, particularlysmall to medium scale, can cheaply and flexiblyenter into fruitful contracts, e.g., through subcontractingfrom big companies by simply publishing their businessprocesses and the services they offer. More business processsupport by the web service infrastructure is howeverneeded before such a paradigm change can materialize.A service for searching and matchmaking of businessprocesses does not yet exist in the current infrastructure.We believe that such a service is needed and willenable companies and organizations to be able to establishad-hoc business relations without relying on manuallynegotiated interorganizational workflows.

1233703,Dynamic Service Composition in Ambient Intelligence Environment.,"In Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments, some services provided by AmI devices are often not visible to users and to other devices. The existing approaches deal with services'composition and discovery as two independent parts. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on logical reasoning agent system. This system is supported by a communication protocol where agents discover automatically services provided in their environment and construct dynamically composite services. The service composition is constructed from an exchange of idiomatic expressions among agents and users, while the discovery process takes the form of an information request via the communication protocol. The advantage of this approach is that agents are able to acquire knowledge from each other and when interacting with users. This capability will facilitate the satisfaction of userâ€™s requirements in an intelligent way. This study shows that agents are able to satisfy new services previously unknown to the system.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233704,Towards Autonomic Service Discovery A Survey and Comparison.,"Service-oriented architecture has become the standard paradigm for software component integration. However, with the permanently increasing amount of available services and dynamic changes, the complexity of such service infrastructures, their maintenance, and consequently the expenditures spent for their operation increase equally. To deal with these effects, an improvement of service composition and discovery becomes necessary, especially a higher degree of automation. Following the idea of Autonomic Computing, which similarly aims at automating processes and workflows to a high degree, service composition and discovery have to proceed autonomously, which will on the one hand side reduce human involvement to a minimum, but on the other side require certain capabilities on the part of these mechanisms. For these purposes, in this paper we define prime criteria that have to be fulfilled for an autonomic service discovery. Based on that we present a comprehensive survey on existing service discovery approaches and evaluate to which extent they already fulfill these criteria. As a result, the paper reveals that there already exist some approaches that support or even fulfill a couple of the proposed criteria, which principally enables autonomic properties, but what is missing is an holistic approach focusing explicitly on providing autonomic properties.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233705,Web Service Substitution Based on Preferences Over Non-functional Attributes.,"In many applications involving composite Web services, one or more component services may become unavailable. This presents us with the problem of identifying other components that can take their place, while maintaining the overall functionality of the composite service. Given a choice of candidate substitutions that offer the desired functionality, it is often necessary to select the most preferred substitution based on non-functional attributes of the service, e.g., security, reliability, etc. We propose an approach to this problem using preference networks for representing and reasoning about preferences over non-functional properties. We present algorithms for solving several variants of this problem: a) when the choice of the preferred substitution is independent of the other constituents of the composite service; b) when the choice of the preferred substitution depends on the other constituents of the composite service; and c) when multiple constituents of a composite service need to be replaced simultaneously. The proposed solutions to the service substitution problem based on preferences over non-functional properties are independent of the specific formalism used to represent functional requirements of a composite service as well as the specific algorithm used to assemble the composite service.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233706,Context Aware Middleware Architecture for Wireless Sensor Network.,"Wireless sensor networks are application specific,data centric networks where different applications run on deployed network. Each application interprets the underlying sensor network differently and each changing event has different effect on running applications.In this paper we have proposed context aware middleware architecture called as â€™MidSenâ€™. This architecture bridges the gap between multiple applications running at application level and deployed sensor networks.MidSen architecture handles static as well as dynamically changing network and application components.MidSen has adopted a rule based engine to handle system dynamics. Midsen makes applications flexible by allowing them to update their rules against knowledge base. Our experimental results show that proposed Context Aware Service Discovery (CASD)algorithm gives better recall value and precision compare to previously proposed discovery algorithms.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233707,Organizing Documented Processes.,"A frequent hurdle in applying Business Process Management(BPM) to large enterprises is that, since business processes are not only numerous but also documented in an engagement in multiple representations,it is difficult to work with the documented 'as-is' or 'to-be' state of the business, leave aside make accurate transformation decisions. In this paper, we consider the problem of how to reconcile and organize documented information about processes into groups that convey inter-process similarity. The discovered knowledge can be used for many applications like search, e.g., find all requirements across all available processes that are similar to those of the ""Account Receivable"" process. The method has been tested on a dataset consisting of hundreds of processes documented in Word and Visio, wherefrom it could find process clusters that significantly boosted search performance.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233708,Towards a Unified Approach for Business Process Modeling Using Context-Based Artifacts and Web Services.,"Service-Oriented Architecture is a paradigm for modeling and enacting business processes that promotes improved flexibility and monitor ability through the composition of loosely-coupled Web services. However, such process-centric composition, with focus on invoking Web services to reach a stated goal, still does not provide the desired flexibility. Web services implementations are typically locked into the business logic of the business processes that they implement. Additionally,monitoring such Web services compositions becomes cumbersome especially for business analysts and managers who are not IT experts. To address these issues, this paper presents a unified process- and data-centric approach with focus on Web services as a driving element to the changes affecting both processes and data. In this approach a business process is modeled as a collection of interacting (business) artifacts, each of which behaves as per a predefined state transition system called Artifact Life-Cycle (ALC). An ALC is enriched with contextual details, which permits business process execution monitoring. Throughout this paper, a realistic running example in the purchase order domain is used for illustration purposes.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233709,Design Pattern for Object Triple Mapping.,"Up to now, developing software for the Semantic Web is much more complex than developing software for other data representation paradigms, such as relational data bases. Software development for relational databases is dram a tically simplified by so-called object-relational map pers. Due to the conceptual difference be tweenrelat ion al databases and the Semantic Web, the design pat terns for object-relational mapping cannot directly be used for lin ked data. In this paper we show how design pat terns for ob ject-relational mapping can be used to achieve the more complex object triple mapping, which will make developing Semantic Web-enabled software much easier.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In most cases, evolutionary approaches are used to deal with the arising complexity. However, most of the existing design methodologies and implementation strategies focus on more technical, service realization specific aspects. Challenges regarding the definition and the management of related service artifacts throughout the whole service lifecycle are neglected. Also the implementation of a lifecycle-encompassing information management infrastructure is not addressed adequately in research and industry. In this paper we introduce a common service management information model (coSIM) that builds a foundation for the management of services and service infrastructures during design-, run- , and change-time.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233712,A Public-View Approach to Timed Properties Verification for B2B Web Service Compositions.,"Timed properties are an important quality criterion in Business-to-Business (B2B) Web service compositions. To guarantee the correctness of these compositions, the deadlock freeness as well as some non-functional properties such as timed constraints should be satisfied. Since there are some recent research efforts concerning the correctness of service composition from the structural and behavioral compatibility perspective, this paper will mainly focus on the timed properties verification. Existing verification techniques however need to know all the activities and activitiesâ€™ time delays of the whole process, thus these techniques are infeasible when some business parties are unwilling to reveal their internal process for privacy or business reasons. To address this problem, a timing property preserving public view approach is proposed. By composing those public views published by all the participants, timed verification can be conducted so that business parties can identify suitable services that meet their timed requirements. A case study of B2B collaboration is included to illustrate our approach.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233713,Multi-dimensional Knowledge Integration for Efficient Incident Management in a Services Cloud.,"The increasing complexity and dynamics in IT infrastructure and the emerging Cloud services present challenges to timely incident/problem diagnosis and resolution. In this paper we present a problem determination platform with multi-dimensional knowledge integration (e.g. configuration data, system vital data, log data, related tickets) and enablement for efficient incident and problem management of the enterprise. Three features of the platform are discussed: automated ticket classification, the automated association of resource with tickets based on integration with configuration database, and the collection of the system vitals relevant to the ticket through integration with monitoring systems. In response to the emerging Cloud services and their highly dynamic service operation context, we identify the need for a proactive service management approach which incorporates configurations and deployment of incident management tools, policies, and templates throughout the service life cycle in order to enable effective and efficient incident management in service operation.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233714,Dependency Analysis Framework for Software Service Delivery.,"Various phases in the delivery of software services such as solution design, application deployment, and maintenance require analysis of the dependencies of software products that form the solution. As software systems become more complex and involve a large number of software products from multiple vendors, availability of correct and up-to-date system requirement information becomes critical to ensure proper functioning of managed and maintained software solutions. System requirement information, is mostly made available in unstructured formats from sources such as websites or product documents and are not amenable to programmatic analysis. In this paper, we motivate the benefits of capturing this information in a structured format for software service delivery, and present a dependency analysis system that collects and integrates software dependency/interoperability information from multiple unstructured sources using text mining techniques. Information hence collected, is used to support analytics useful in software service delivery. We report the results of our experiments on mining millions of web pages to collect dependency information for more than 700 software products.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233715,A Security Meta-model for Service-Oriented Architectures.,"Services account for a major part of the IT industry today. Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services. Since 2004, the International Conference on Services Computing (SCC) has provided a platform for practitioners to present the latest advances in services science. Like its predecessors, SCC 2009 will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Service Computing.Services Computing currently shapes the thinking of business modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and software architecture design, development and deployment. The global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different business models. SCC 2009 will help in bridging the gap between business services and information technology by driving research in technologies such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, service engineering and grid/utility computing and Web 2.0. The theme of the conference is ""Innovation in Globally Integrated Services"". SCC 2009 will have the following major tracks: Foundations of Services Computing, Service Computing Practices and Applications and Business Aspects of Service Computing.SCC 2009 is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing.

1233716,An Optimal Capacity Planning Algorithm for Provisioning Cluster-Based Failure-Resilient Composite Services.,"Resilience against unexpected server failures is a key desirable function of quality-assured service systems. A good capacity planning decision should cost-effectively allocate spare capacity for exploiting failure resilience mechanisms. In this paper, we propose an optimal capacity planning algorithm for server-cluster based service systems,particularly the ones that provision composite services via several servers. The algorithm takes into account two commonly used failure resilience mechanisms: intra-cluster load-controlling and inter-cluster failover. The goal is to minimize the resource cost while assuring service levels on the end-to-end throughput and response time of provisioned composite services under normal conditions and server failure conditions. We illustrate that the stated goal can be formalized as a capacity planning optimization problem and can be solved mathematically via convex analysis and linear optimization techniques. We also quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can find the min-cost capacity planning solution that assures the end-to-end performance of managed composite services for both the non-failure case and the common server failure cases in a three-tier web-based service system with multiple server clusters. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first research effort in optimizing the cost of supporting failure resilience for quality-assured composite services.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233717,Quantitative Modeling of Communication Cost for Global Service Delivery.,"IT service providers are increasingly utilizing globally distributed resources to drive down costs, reduce risk through diversification and gain access to a larger talent pool. However, fostering effective collaboration among geographically distributed resources is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we present our initial attempt to quantify the increased overhead in leveraging distributed resources as one of the project costs. We associate this overhead cost measurement with metrics that measure communication quality, such as reduction in productivity and communication delay. These metrics can in turn be computed as functions of underlying project parameters. To achieve this goal, we first build a project communication model (PCM) to categorize different types of collaborative communication. We then represent communication efficiency and changes in resource availability in terms of information theoretic concepts such as reduced channel capacity, information encoding efficiency and channel availability. This analysis is used to help determine the cost associated with team formation and task distribution during the project planning phase.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233718,Automatically Deriving Choreography-Conforming Systems of Services.,"We present a formal method to derive a set of web services from a given choreography, in such a way that the system consisting of these services necessarily conforms to the choreography. A formal model to represent orchestrations and choreographies is given, and we define several conformance semantic relations allowing to detect whether a set of orchestration models, representing some web services, leads to the overall communications described by a choreography.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233719,Protecting Sensitive Customer Information in Call Center Recordings.,"Protecting sensitive information while preserving the share ability and usability of data is becoming increasingly important in the outsourced business process industry. Particularly in the context of call-centers a lot of customer related sensitive information is stored in audio recordings. In this work, we address the problem of protecting sensitive customer information in audio recordings and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts. The high word error rates, spontaneous nature of communication and the variability in agent-customer interaction makes it harder and expensive to craft rules or build annotators to detect sensitive information. In this paper we propose a semi supervised method to model sensitive information as a directed graph which is automatically generated from ASR transcripts. Vocabularies specific to the nodes are generated using features of context sensitive clusters. The direction and weight of the edge capture the ordering and timing constraints respectively for these features. These constraints are learnt from the time stamps associated with ASR transcripts. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of detecting and locating credit card transaction in real life conversations between agents and customer of a call center.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233720,ITBVM: IT Business Value Modeler.,"Today, enterprise IT environments are complex as never before with individual applications, tiers, or technologies segregated into individual management domains.Typically, the value of business applications and the dependencies between business and IT objects and IT objects among each other is completely unknown or at least not up to date.Thus, ultimately, the business value of individual IT tasks is unknown.Hence it is very hard to perform global management services such as performance optimization in resource-constrained environments.This deficiency is even more deeply felt by an internal or external services provider called in to set up a new optimization or IT management framework.We propose a framework ITBVM for business-value driven IT optimization with particular emphasis on such enterprise environments.A key part is the use of discovery technologies to provide the link between business value and IT objects. As one instance of the framework, we show how discovery can improve a performance-optimization problem in an otherwise blackbox scenario.We validate these improvements through experiments in a controlled setup and through statistical interpretation of fine-grained dependency discovery in a large real enterprise environment.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233721,A Service Oriented Architecture for Personalized Rich Media Delivery.,"Multimedia streaming means delivering continuous data to a plethora of client devices. Besides the actual data transport this also needs a high degree of content adaptation respecting the end usersâ€™ needs given by the form of content preferences, transcoding constraints, and device capabilities.When it comes to content editing (like mixing in subtitles or picture-in-picture composition) relying on third party service providers may be necessary. For improved efficiency all adaptation should be done in a service-oriented way, because a lot of adaptation modules can be reused within different adaptation workflows. In this paper we discuss the extensions of Web service frameworks, and present a first implementation of a service-oriented framework for media streaming and digital item adaptation, concentrating on the technical realization of the services. Our experimental results show the praticality of the actual deployment of service-oriented multimedia frameworks.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233722,Extracting Behavioral Models from WS-BPEL Processes for Service Discovery.,"As service behavior plays a key role in service interaction, behavior-based service discovery has been increasingly recognized as a critical activity for service-based systems. However, little attention has been paid to the retrieval of behavioral models, which is critical for behavior-based discovery. This paper proposes an approach for extracting service behavioral models from WS-BPEL, which has been emerging as the prominent language for service orchestration. Our approach identifies all participants involved in a WS-BPEL process and abstracts the interaction of the process with its participants through behavioral models. Furthermore, we distinguish three types of ordering constraints between activities in behavioral models. Based on this, we present a mechanism to automatically adapt WS-BPEL processes to find and use other similar services when no service satisfies exactly the specified requirements. We have implemented a prototype to demonstrate and evaluate our approach.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Business Process layer leverages the Service layer to quickly compose and choreograph services and to coordinate business processes to fulfill customer requirements. Based on industry practice, we introduce a set of architectural building blocks of the layer, together with the interdependencies and interactions between them, to componentize the Business Process layer in the context of SOA Reference Architecture. We also report industry experiences of applying this layer in SOA solution engagements.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233725,JabberWocky: Crowd-Sourcing Metadata for Files.,"Finding relevant files in a personal file system continues to be a challenge. It is still easier to find stuff on the Web with its exponential growth than in oneâ€™s personal file system. Yet, the exponential growth of personal data renders the current services of personal file systems increasingly inadequate. A reason for this failure is the â€œcold-startâ€ù problem: algorithms that dramatically improve a userâ€™s ability to find documents on the Web become ineffective in personal file systems because there is not enough information about these documents. We propose JabberWocky, a service that allows users to manage the content of their personal file system by leveraging semantic relationships available on the Web. More specifically, JabberWocky is using keyword/resource associations of social bookmarking web sites as a basis for recommending keywords for files. We chose social bookmarking web sites because of their popularity and because the assignment of keywords (a process also referred to as â€œtaggingâ€ù) is an established and popular way to manage photos, music, movies, and audio resources on the Web â€“ very much the kind of resources that need to be managed in personal file systems. The goal of JabberWocky is to overcome the â€œcold-startâ€ù problem of personal file systems and to provide recommendations in a scalable way while maintaining the userâ€™s privacy. In this work-in-progress report we describe the motivation and challenges of designing a system like JabberWocky, present the initial design of an on-going user study, and briefly discuss what we have learned so far.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233726,Cost-Effective Semantic Annotation of XML Schemas and Web Service Interfaces.,"Research in the field of semantic Web services aims at automating the discovery, selection, composition and management of Web services based on semantic descriptions. However, the applicability of many solutions developed in this field is hampered by the costs associated with semantically annotating large repositories of Web services. To overcome this gap we propose a practical method for semantically annotating collections of XML Schemas and Web service interfaces. We have evaluated this method on a large repository of governmental Web services. The evaluation shows that relatively simple techniques are surprisingly cost-effective, saving hundreds of man-hours of semantic annotation effort. Moreover, the proposed method does not assume the availability of a preexisting ontology or controlled vocabulary. Instead, the space of annotations is dynamically built during the annotation process.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233727,Towards Providing Value Based Differentiated QoS.,"In this paper we present a model for delivering differentiated quality of service based on the value for the provider. The value for the provider is captured by taking into account the i) client value, ii) service value, and certain exogenous factors. We enumerate and articulate different dimensions which will affect these components. We present a couple of case studies to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model. The first case study is from Retail Banking based on our real life experience of deploying a service delivery system in a leading bank in India. The second case study is from a Business Process Outsourcing industry. We also define the notion of value plot to visualize the relative importance of customers from value perspective and highlight how the value plot can be used for both operational as well as strategic planning in service delivery.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In particular, our extended model enables the verification of properties commonly used to validate context dependent applications. We also propose a set of algorithms to verify these properties efficiently.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233729,Alignment of Choreography Changes in BPEL Processes.,"Choreography changes performed by one party may affect other parties. The changes and the implication for other parties can be determined. However, the required changes on the orchestration are difficult to determine since a choreography is an abstraction of the orchestration and thus information is lost. In this paper an approach is proposed to enrich the orchestration with the observed changes using a syntactical representation of the orchestration language and semantic invariants of the orchestration language.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233730,QoS Analysis for Web Service Composition.,"The quality of service (QoS) is a major concern in the design and management of Web service composition. Existing methods for QoS calculation either do not take the probability of path execution into consideration when QoSs are provided for different execution paths, or do not take different execution paths into consideration when a single integrated QoS is provided for the whole composition. In this paper, a comprehensive QoS analysis approach is proposed that calculates the QoS probability distribution by considering both the execution probability and execution conditions of each path in the service composition. Four types of basic composition patterns in the service composition are discussed: sequential, parallel, loop and conditional. In particular, a QoS solution is provided for all types of loop structured service composition.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233731,Ontology-based Information Sharing in Service-Oriented Database Systems.,"This paper presents a novel information sharing framework using Service-Oriented Database System (SODB) for service registry and repository that facilitates data integration. A SODB is a database architecture composed with reusable services to support searching, querying, deleting, and storing data. As SODB is organized in a service-oriented manner, SODB can be easily changed or maintained by reusing different services. Thus, it can be used to share information in the cloud. The Information Sharing System (ISS) component of the SODB employs domain ontology to share data sources. The domain ontology utilizes mathematical equivalence relations to map data sources into appropriate domain ontology. It also facilitates dynamic query composition across data sources. This paper also presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of the ISS component. Our implementation is based on a real application, the Arizona Healthcare Cost Containment System (AHCCCS). This application demonstrates that the ISS can facilitate complex information integration. Finally, this paper presents the performance of the ISS using WAPT (Web Application Testing) for Microsoft Windows XP, and the response time consistently fall in between 0.1 to 0.15 second for each request.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233732,Integrated Constraint Violation Handling for Dynamic Service Composition.,"Dynamic service composition is suitable for on-demand business requests. For autonomic computing, service composition needs to deal with runtime environment faults, but also with business constraint violations which result from business requirements. We propose an approach for integrated handling of business constraint violations and runtime environment faults for dynamic service composition.We introduce a loosely coupled implementation architecture to maintain the platform-independent nature.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233733,Identifying Client Goals for Web Service Discovery.,"Web service discovery has become a daunting task primarily due to its inability for allowing clients to articulate proper service search queries. Improving the quality of service search results could not be achieved unless we determine ways for correctly identifying Web service query goals. In this paper, we identify client goals when performing a Web service search. As part of this work, we introduce the concept of Quality of Web Service (QWS) for our quality-driven discovery mechanism. We determine that client goals in service discovery can be defined as exploratory or informational. We use this information to demonstrate how the knowledge of client goals can become beneficial in improving the way clients conduct service search queries. Results from our experiments are intriguing and show that the performance of informational service queries in terms of precision improve the querying process by 36.26% and 40.39% when compared to Googleâ€™s PageRank and Yahoo, respectively. We further use our findings to provide insights on improving the service retrieval process.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233734,Theoretical Framework for Eliminating Redundancy in Workflows.,"In this paper we look at combining and compressing a set of workflows, such that computation can be minimized. In this context, we look at two novel theoretical problems with applications in workflow systems and services research, which are duals of each other. The first problem looks at merging the maximum number of vertices in two DAGs (directed acyclic graphs) without creating a cycle. We prove that the dual of this problem is the problem of maximizing the length of the LCS (longest common subsequence) between all pairs of topological orderings of the two DAGs. This formulation generalizes to a new definition of LCS between complex structures like workflows or XML documents, which we call M-LCS. Subsequently, we present a taxonomy of the different kinds of problems in this set, and find the M-LCS solution for a tree and a chain with a dynamic programming algorithm.Along with this theoretical formulation, we implement the algorithms in C++ and run it on representative workflows. We evaluate the performance of the M-LCS algorithm on a set of random workflows and observe that it is substantially better than traditional AI based approaches.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233735,Cloud Security Issues.,"In past three decades, the world of computation has changed from centralized (client-server not web-based) to distributed systems and now we are getting back to the virtual centralization (Cloud Computing). Location of data and processes makes the difference in the realm of computation. On one hand, an individual has full control on data and processes in his/her computer. On the other hand, we have the cloud computing wherein, the service and data maintenance is provided by some vendor which leaves the client/customer unaware of where the processes are running or where the data is stored. So, logically speaking, the client has no control over it. The cloud computing uses the internet as the communication media. When we look at the security of data in the cloud computing, the vendor has to provide some assurance in service level agreements (SLA) to convince the customer on security issues. Organizations use cloud computing as a service infrastructure, critically like to examine the security and confidentiality issues for their business critical insensitive applications. Yet, guaranteeing the security of corporate data in the ""cloud"" is difficult, if not impossible, as they provide different services like Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Each service has their own security issues. So the SLA has to describe different levels of security and their complexity based on the services to make the customer understand the security policies that are being implemented. There has to be a standardized way to prepare the SLA irrespective to the providers. This can help some of the enterprises to look forward in using the cloud services. In this paper, we put forward some security issues that have to be included in SLA.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233736,A Case Study on Bi-lateral Resource Integration Oriented Marine Logistics Service System.,"Marine logistics service is one of the fundamental production services supporting the import and export businesses of other industries. The current marine logistics service eco-system formed spontaneously, and during its development, various types of service providers were stepwise imported and complex business collaborations formed between them. Based on our investigation on marine logistics services between South Korea and Weihai, China, we found that some deficiencies existed in such a decentralized service eco-system and led to non-optimized quality of marine logistics service. To solve these issues, we designed a bi-lateral resource integration oriented solution, in which a third-party service agency is established to help cargo owners and various logistics providers set up mutual service relationships, integrate bi-lateral resources, and monitor and evaluate quality/credit of services, thereby improving QoS and customer satisfaction. Business operation mechanisms, especially profit patterns, are briefly discussed. Benefits and disadvantages of BIRIS-based solutions are analyzed. Business and technological lessons learned from the solution are briefly put forward. Finally some possible directions for future innovations and improvements are discussed.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233737,Optimal Replacement Policy of Services Based on Markov Decision Process.,"Traditional approaches towards self-healing of services, have emphasized reactive self-healing; viz., stopping a failed service, replacing/reconfiguring it and restarting. Since this is disruptive, we investigate a proactive self-healing approach in this paper. The key issue in proactive self-healing, is the decision by the consumer, based on available observations of the performance of the provider service, to decide when to replace the currently running service (in case of atomic service)before the service fails, or when to replace a component service(in case of composite service), and in a manner that minimizes the cost involved in this replacement. In this paper we address this problem via a Markov Decision Process. We determine the optimal value and define the best action to be taken, when the consumer service is in a particular state of loss due to QoS failure of the provider service. Since the current state is known,our decision will help in proactive self-healing, by initiating service replacement earlier, and thereby minimizing losses to the consumer. We illustrate our ideas using a realistic example in the purchase order domain, and present an implementation prototype for the same.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233738,Ensuring Coordination of Multi-business Interactions.,"While the potential benefits of multi-business interaction automation are truly phenomenal, the complexity of business has increased dramatically, and building reliable and secure e-business application systems becomes an important issue. Industry standards for Web service composition, such as BPEL, provide the notion of LRT (Long running transaction) for the execution of business processes in Web service collaborations. Formal verification of BPEL programs and specifications has become a hot topic. However, the notion of LRT described in BPEL is purely local and occurs within a single business process instance. In this work a two-step model checking method, from simply to the complex, is proposed for multi-business process. A preliminary step is to judge business correctness on external logic transition relations amongst businesses with various simple symbolic model checking tools, and then make further checking interaction validation based on internal system behavior in multi-business coordination with model checking verification environment for mobile processes. The typical scenario is illustrated to show how model checking is applied to verify the reliability of multi-business coordination.

1233739,Model Aware Execution of Composite Web Services.,"One of the most interesting aspects of WSs is the possibility to combine them into Composite Web Services (CWSs). While Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) has emerged as the most popular language to orchestrate services, it introduces serious challenges with respect to the manageability of CWSs. This paper shows an approach to overcome these challenges with a model-aware execution of CWSs based on the Coloured Petri Nets(CPN) modeling language. Although the use of any mathematically grounded formalism enables verification of properties of CWSs, here it is used at runtime to guide the execution of the CWS. This paper presents the architecture and evaluation of using CPN as means for the model-aware execution, monitoring and runtime optimizations of CWSs. Compared to BPEL, the model-aware approach based on CPN significantly improves the performance.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233740,Service Innovation in Value-Network through Clusters Consolidation.,"Nowadays, the rapidly changing technology development and the demand to provide high-end solutions to customers needs increase the opportunity of networking various small enterprises, offering service oriented businesses. The existing value network should be, viewed as a fluid infrastructure, clustering together various enterprises (sub-networks). Based on the business scenario of individual enterprisesâ€™ in a specified time interval, few subnets maybe underutilized and few subnets may be over-utilized, thereby necessitates periodic changes in the distribution of customers. Here we propose a number of redesign operations on the customersâ€™ clusters (enterprises), which are sub-networks in the value network, with the conscious to minimize the extra-traffic in the backbone network. Thus we have proposed an optimization re-design problem to reduce the extra-traffic at the value network and maximize the intra-traffic within the clusters (subnets) by considering customersâ€™ movement and clusters consolidation. We have utilized Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to search for the best solution to the re-clustering problem. Our simulation results show a better trade-off in minimizing the extra-traffic through clusters consolidation and improve efficiency in operations for the service providers.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233741,Effective Knowledge Sharing in Service Systems.,"A model of a knowledge intensive service system is introduced to study knowledge sharing in these systems.Simulation experiments based on the model are conducted to relate particular aspects of knowledge creation and sharing to a metric of service performance. The results indicate that certain network configurations of knowledge sharing among the service provider agents have performance advantages over others. In addition, the degree of fallibility associated with shared knowledge has a significant impact on performance. This paper is part of a research program that investigates the knowledge dynamics within service systems with particular focus on the influence of human, social and structural factors.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233742,Evaluating Service Identification with Design Metrics on Business Process Decomposition.,"One of the key activities to construct a successful Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the identification of services with the right level of abstraction. Most of existing SOA design methodologies advocate identifying services from the top-down decomposition of business processes. However, the identification quality in these methodologies heavily depends on the expertise and experience of individual designers. The ability to quantitatively evaluate service identification is absolutely needed. In this paper, we propose an approach that supports such evaluation by applying the measurement technology to the service-based business process decomposition. A model to capture related architectural elements with their relationships is presented. A set of design metrics are proposed for measuring various features of identified services in the service portfolio, including service granularity, coupling, cohesion, and business entity convergence. To apply the approach, a prototypical measurement tool for service identification is developed. An automotive work order scenario is used as an illustration example to explain our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233743,A Holistic View of Industry Standards Across SOA Solution Stack.,"Businesses recently began shifting from proprietary models towards industry standards. Today, when businesses are faced with medium and large SOA projects, they strive to standardize their business process models, information models, and message models by complying with known industry standards. As service orientation and composition become more important, these standards also become critical for efficient SOA integration. However, in doing so, the businesses face a new challenge â€“ the challenge to effectively utilize the industry standards models. Using industry standards models effectively is difficult since they are typically large and complex, thus resulting in the creation of vast amounts of inter-relationships. To meet this challenge, we describe a new approach that provides a holistic view of these heterogeneous SOA models and corresponding industry standards. Such a unified view must provide access to heterogeneous data sources and models, allow search and query of them as a single model source all across the SOA solution stack, and provide advanced services such as traceability, scoping, and impact analysis. To validate the proposed holistic approach, we describe a model catalog and repository system and present its use on a field-based example.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233744,Enhancing Claim-Based Identity Management by Adding a Credibility Level to the Notion of Claims.,"Claim-based identity management denotes an open identity model which uses the notion of claims to describe identity attributes. A claim is an identity attribute named with an abstract identifier (e.g. a URI), which applications and services can use to specify the attributes they need. Open and extensible formats for the exchange of identity attributesensure interoperability among different identity systems. For this reason, claim-based identity management lays the ground for Identity Metasystems, which provide an identity layer on top of existing identity systems and promise an easier management of digital identities among the Internet.However, the Internet grew into an environment of mostly isolated domains for a good reason. Service providers find it hard to accept identity information from any other than the own domain. While claim-based identity management provides the means to specify identity information on a per-attribute basis, trust is usually defined in a general manner. Service providers state the issuers of identity information, they trust, but do not restrict for what. In this paper, we argue that for a truly decentralized management of identity information, trust should be defined on the same granular level as identity information. We propose a model which considers trust on a per-claim basis. In our model, trust into a claim is defined as the assumed correctness and integrity of a claim in dependence of the issuer. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a small flight booking scenario which uses claims augmented with an expected trust level to show how we can achieve more flexibility for the user in his choice of an identity provider when considering not only whom to trust, but for what.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233745,Managing Configuration Complexity during Deployment and Maintenance of SOA Solutions.,"Successful deployment and maintenance of enterprise SOA solutions involves configuring and managing several middleware software stacks. These middleware stacks have several hundreds to thousands of configuration attributes to be configured and managed. Ineffective Management of configuration information increases the cost, labor and time of troubleshooting configuration problems. The reason for it are two-folds: (a) configuration dependencies cut across different software stacks and there is no formal method to capture and consolidate them, and (b) incorrect configuration of attributes results in runtime exceptions. Correlating exceptions obtained during runtime to deployment/maintenance time configuration values is difficult as the context of the error is lost and is often not traceable. Current approaches to managing and troubleshooting problems associated with configuration information involve extensive human labor which comes at a premium. In this paper, we introduce Configuration Map (CM), which is an ordered set of configuration attributes for a deployable middleware component. Such a map when associated with exceptions helps reduce the cost of resolving configuration problems. We present several use cases and show from real life deployment scenarios that CM significantly reduces the cost of labor and time.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233746,Effective Decision Support for Workforce Deployment Service Systems.,"An IT services businesses must continually manage the assignment and movement of practitioners to or between projects balancing multiple objectives (1) to minimize their idle bench, while aiming (2) to increase revenue from new project opportunities. The key to simultaneously achieving these objectives is a well managed Service System for Workforce Deployment with distributed decision making. In this paper, we discuss the decision support needs for this Service System, and present a decision support tool that computes an 'optimal' assignment of practitioners to projects,and improves the effectiveness and efficiency of this assignment process. The tool comprises of a matching module that matches practitioners to project openings, an optimization module that produces globally optimal recommendations, and a user interface for displaying the recommendations. We describe the decision support tool, our experiences with developing and deploying it in an IT services company, and our efforts to promote a common shared perspective among decision-makers enabling multiple decision makers to independently arrive at near-optimal decisions using the tool recommendations.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233747,Ensuring Quality of Services at Runtime A Case Study.,"Designing the Qualities of Services (QoS) and verifying their ensuring at runtime are key issues addressed by today information systems.

Our approach is based on the main concepts of the Service Oriented Architecture and exploits the Service Level Agreements to express QoS and adaptive mechanisms to monitor and change QoS at runtime.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233748,A Model for Designing Generic Services.,"This paper describes a model for capturing service designs and the design of service product lines. The model promotes reuse of service artifacts, enables a balanced view of the service from different stakeholder viewpoints, and provides a foundation for design for service quality. The model leverages a phased approach to design, engineering and management of services. The model has applicability throughout the service lifecycle and provides a standardized vocabulary and structure for designing and maintaining generic services, irrespective of the domain of application.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233749,Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Problem Determination in IT Services.,"Problem determination in a large and dynamic IT service is a challenging task. In this paper we propose a framework for problem determination based on monitoring the event streams generated by the different components of an IT service. We give a generic representation of a problem through spatial-temporal patterns, which is a graph where the vertices capture the location and the time of the matching events, and the edges represent the spatio-temporal conditions between two matching events. The spatial conditions are based on the underlying system topology graph, and the temporal conditions are based on event timestamps.A practical implementation of the above framework will require fast algorithms for detecting patterns. We present efficient algorithms when the pattern graph is a range and a tree, which are then used as building blocks for a hierarchical heuristic for detecting general patterns. Finally, we show that our algorithms perform well in practice through extensive numerical simulations.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233750,Analyzing Impact Factors on Composite Services.,"Although Web services are intended for short term, ad hoc collaborations, in practice many Web service compositions are offered longterm to customers. While the Web services making up the composition may vary, the structure of the composition is rather fixed. For companies managing such Web service compositions, however, challenges arise which go far beyond simple bilateral contract monitoring. It is not only important to determine whether or not a component(i.e., Web service) in a composition is performing properly, but also to understand what the impact of its performance is on the overall service composition. In this paper we show which challenges emerge and we provide an approach on determining the impact each Web service has on the composition at runtime.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233751,Clustering Web Services for Automatic Categorization.,"Analyzing the functionality of Web services is the basis of using Web services effectively and efficiently. The first step in such analysis of Web services is to categorize different services, which may be offered by different service providers, based on their functionalities. In this paper, we present a clustering-based approach to Web service categorization in order to form a hierarchy of service taxonomy. Our novel clustering scheme takes into consideration not only individual factors such as input or output of service operations, but also the latent inter-relationships among the individual factors. Given a set of services that may or may not have been categorized, we adopt individual methods to handle the issue and mark out their classification labels in terms of a common (given) taxonomy, such as UNSPSC. When a new service description is published, the unclassified service is compared with the classified ones and measures of the likelihood that the new service description is belonging to each cluster are calculated. Based on this calculation, the service will be assigned to a suitable category.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233752,Change Propagation in Process Models Using Behavioural Profiles.,"Business process change is at the very core of business process management, which aims at enabling flexible adaptation to changing business needs. However, the wide variety of drivers for business process modeling initiatives, reaching from business evolution to process enactment, results in multiple models that overlap in content due to serving different purposes. That, in turn, imposes serious challenges for the propagation of changes between these process models. Given a change in one model, this paper introduces an approach to determine a change region in another model by exploiting the behavioral profile of corresponding activities. It, therefore, supports the process of change propagation and eases the synchronization of process models significantly. As a major contribution, our approach can handle changes in pairs of models, even if they are not defined in terms of a hierarchical refinement.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233753,Web2Exchange: A Model-Based Service Transformation and Integration Environment.,"The rush is on to service-enable everything, and those that fail to capitalize on this trend will be left behind in the marketplace. While new applications can be written for this environment, substantial value exists in legacy applications and systems. Successfully service enabling these applications is not easy for software vendors due to the complexity of integration. To address this problem, we focus on the issue of service specification using models which clearly capture the scope, capability and state of a service. Such models make integration of services more certain and can allow previously incompatible services to be combined more easily. We have prototyped Web2Exchange, a platform for modeling, transforming and integrating services. We have publicly demonstrated the platform by showcasing a ""mashup"" of the HP Opencall Media platform with web-based calendaring in November of 2008. Since then, we have developed additional services on the platform, and are beginning to make the platform available to others outside of our organization.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233754,A Task Abstraction and Mapping Approach to the Shimming Problem in Scientific Workflows.,"Recently, there has been an increasing need in scientific workflows to solve the shimming problem, the use of a special kind of adaptors, called shims, to link related but incompatible workflow tasks. However, existing techniques produce scientific workflows that are cluttered with many visible shims, which distract a scientistâ€™s focus on functional components. Moreover, these techniques do not address a new type of shimming problem that occurs due to the incompatibility between the ports of a task and the inputs/outputs of its internal task component. To address these issues, 1) we propose a task template model which encapsulates the composition and mapping of shims and functional task component within a task interface; 2) we design an XML based task specification language, called TSL, to realize the proposed task template model; 3) we propose a service oriented architecture for task management to enable the distributed execution of shims and functional components; and 4) we implement the proposed model, language and architecture and present a case study to validate them. Our technique uniquely addresses both types of shimming problems. To our best knowledge, this is the first shimming technique that makes shims invisible at the workflow level, resulting in scientific workflows that are more elegant and readable.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233755,Effective Detection of SQL/XPath Injection Vulnerabilities in Web Services.,"This paper proposes a new automatic approach for the detection of SQL Injection and XPath Injection vulnerabilities, two of the most common and most critical types of vulnerabilities in web services. Although there are tools that allow testing web applications against security vulnerabilities, previous research shows that the effectiveness of those tools in web services environments is very poor. In our approach a representative workload is used to exercise the web service and a large set of SQL/XPath Injection attacks are applied to disclose vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are detected by comparing the structure of the SQL/XPath commands issued in the presence of attacks to the ones previously learned when running the workload in the absence of attacks. Experimental evaluation shows that our approach performs much better than known tools (including commercial ones), achieving extremely high detection coverage while maintaining the false positives rate very low.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233756,Reconfigurable SCA Applications with the FraSCAti Platform.,"The Service Component Architecture (SCA) is a technology agnostic standard for developing and deploying distributed service-oriented applications. However, SCA does not define standard means for runtime manageability (including introspection and reconfiguration) of SOA applications and of their supporting environment. This paper presents the FraSCAti platform, which brings runtime management features to SCA, and discusses key principles in its design: the adoption of an extended SCA component model for the implementation of SOA applications and of the FraSCAti platform itself; the use of component-based interception techniques for dynamically weaving non-functional services such as transaction management with components. The paper presents micro-benchmarks that show that runtime manageability in the FraSCAti platform is achieved without hindering its performance relative to the de facto reference SCA implementation, Apache's Tuscany.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233757,Identifying Data Constrained Activities for Migration Planning.,"Constant and rapid changes in the market place have inevitably brought changes to business process including the long running process. When changes are mandatory or require retroactive compliance, it may be necessary to migrate existing running process instances to a new version model. Current dynamic instance adaptation approach requires each instance to adapt to the changes individually. To support multiple instance migration across process models, we present an approach where we leverage model comparison technique; control and data flow analyses to identify data constraints for changed activities and identify potential migration points where we could migrate the instances. We then capture the migration point information in a migration plan which can later be used in the runtime environment to orchestrate the migration. We have implemented a prototype of our approach to demonstrate its applicability.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233758,Managing Faults in the Service Delivery Process of Service Provider Coalitions.,"In recent years, IT Service Management (ITSM) has become one of the most researched areas of IT.Incident Management and Problem Management form the basis of the tooling provided by an Incident Ticket System (ITS).As more compound or interdependent services are collaboratively offered by providers, the delivery of a service therefore becomes a responsibility of more than one provider's organization. In the ITS systems of various providers seemingly unrelated tickets are created and the connection between them is not realized automatically. The introduction of automation will reduce human involvement and time required for incident resolution.In this paper we consider a collaborative service delivery model that supports both per-request services and continuous high-availability services. In the case of high availability service the information stored in the ITS of the provider often includes information on the outage of a particular service rather than on the failure of a particular request. In this paper we offer an information model that consolidates and supports inter-organizational incident management and probabilistic model for fault discovery.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233759,Simplify Stochastic QoS Admission Test for Composite Services through Lower Bound Approximation.,"A composite service can have its overall Quality of Service (QoS) measure computed with the QoS measures of its constituent services. In the stochastic case of QoS modeling, accurate computation for the probability distribution of the composite QoS measure is NP-hard because of the inherent complexities of probability value calculation for the function of discrete random variables. However, given reasonable assumptions on the monotony of the composite QoS function and on the independence of constituent QoS measures, we have proposed a lower bound approximation algorithm that computes the approximate value of the composite QoS distribution for admission test purpose in much lower-order complexity of time even in the worst case. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified and compared against the naive algorithm using simulative trace data.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233760,Port Based Reliability Computing for Service Composition.,"Web service composition is a distributed model to construct new webservice on top of existing primitive or other composite webservices. However, current service technologies, including proposed composition languages, do not address the reliability of web service composition. Thus it is hard to predict the system reliability. In this paper, we propose a method to compute system reliability based on Service Component Architecture(SCA), a standard that provides a language-independent way to define and compose service components in the system. We first present a formal service component signature model with respect to the specification of the SCA assembly model,and then propose a language-independent dynamic behavior model for specifying the interface behavior of the service component by port activities. Then the failure behaviors of ports are defined through the Enhanced Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process(ENHPP). Based on the semantics of ports, several rules have been generated to compute reliabilities of port expressions, thus the overall system reliability can be automatically computed. Finally, a testing bed is given to calculate port reliability.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233761,Constructing a Context-Aware Service-Oriented Reputation Model Using Attention Allocation Points.,"In this paper we examine the problem of rich information environments and the need to narrow the agents attention to what is important for them to interact and later to evaluate and transfer reputation values, using Attention Allocation technique (AA). We also argue that this cannot be done without the aid of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Reputation is used in our work as a service, presenting a new concept- that is Reputation-as-a-Service (RaaS). We then present a service-oriented model for optimizing the presentation and the use of reputation in order to maximize its value to both users and providers.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

1233763,"Agent with Rule Engine: The ""Glue' for Web Service Oriented Computing Applied to Network Management.","Service Oriented Computing (SOC) is the fast emerging successor of the Object Oriented Computing design paradigm. Web Services technology, which is considered as an implementation of the SOC model, has had an incredible acceptance but tumultuous growth. This apparent chaos is due to its inherent lack of flexible cooperation strategies, generic service model and weak semantic description, mainly when deployed for Enterprise Applications with distributed computing transactions. Agent Based Web Services(AWS) is an appropriate approach to implement the Enterprise-Agent Design Model, which aims to overcome these inherent limitations of Web Services. In this paper, we report our ongoing efforts to use AWS in a Network Management System(NMS) we have built. Our NMS employs both SNMP and Mobile Agents(Aglets). We are developing an intelligent software agent, which is integrated with the Drools Rule Engine so that appropriate rules are triggered when pre-defined events occur. Our work is a novel approach covering a multitude of technologies such as SOC, AWS, Rule Engine, SNMP and Mobile Agents, with our Software Agent acting as a `glue' imbibing this synergy.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233764,A Dynamic Compensation Mechanism for Web Transactions.,"Composite services are often long-running, loosely coupled, and cross-platform, so they bring additional complexity to the system in the presence of failures. Transaction is a basic concept in building reliable distributed system. However, Web transaction cannot be easily rolled back as conventional ACID transactions, so a main problem that remains is how to cancel a long-running Web transaction. This paper introduces a calculus based on pi-calculus, which deals with the faults of Web service composition in long-running business processes. The calculus is equipped with operational semantics to guarantee both appropriate installation and activation of compensation of Web Transaction.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Based on problem statement, we propose A Novel Web Services-based Content Delivery Service Peering Scheme (WS-CDSP), and we describe scheme architecture design, which support multiple-to-multiple loosely-coupled peering services through Web Service Information Endpoint and Web Service Management Endpoint. And then we focus on main system function design, Web Service Information Endpoint and Web Service Management Endpoint design mechanism. After that, We discuss CDN or VoD composite resource model based on CIM. As part of experiment work, we discuss WS-CDSP scheme implementation and comparative experiment, and then analyze the experiment results.

1233766,SolutionFinder: Intelligent Knowledge Integration and Dissemination for Solution Retrieval in IT Support Services.,"Online support centers are emerging as a cost-effective and innovative solution designed to enable end-users to resolve technical problems more effectively without relying on live support from contact center agents. However, the capacity limitation of corporate knowledge bases prevents online support centers from effectively resolving user problems. In addition, traditional textual search techniques employed by most online support centers fall short from accurately interpreting user queries due to the ambiguity of user requests and the heterogeneity of technical problems. In this paper, we present SolutionFinder, an autonomous framework, which dynamically integrates online resources to enrich the knowledge base for IT support systems. SolutionFinder provides context-aware search support to remove the textual ambiguity embedded in user queries. Furthermore, SolutionFinder transforms solution documents into solution paths to analyze their similarity to provide high-quality solution recommendations. Evaluation results suggest by leveraging our proposed algorithms, a support service can accurately locate Web solution resources and provide high-quality services.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233767,Service Composition Based on Natural Language Requests.,"The easiest way for a user to express his needs regarding a desired service is to use natural language. The main issues come from the fact that the natural language is incomplete and ambiguous, while the service composition process should lead to valid services. In this paper we propose a natural language service assemblage method based on composition templates (patterns). The use of templates assures that the composition result is always valid. The proposed system, called NLSC (Natural Language Service Composer), was implemented on the top of a service-oriented middleware called WComp and tested in an intelligent home environment.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Web services have become the de facto technology for implementing such applications. One approach for specifying web service calls and interactions is ActiveXML(AXML), a data-oriented workflow language. A problem with state-of-the-art workflow engines for AXML is that the execution is poorly optimized and thus too time-consuming.In a previous short paper, we proposed an optimization approach for workflows specified in AXML. Here, we elaborate on this proposal in more detail, providing the formal descriptions to show the general execution of the optimization rule, the algorithm to group the Web service calls, and an analytical argument for the resulting performance gain.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233769,QoS-Enabled Business-to-Business Integration Using ebBP to WS-BPEL Translations.,"Business-To-Business Integration (B2Bi) is a key mechanism for enterprises to gain competitive advantage. However,developing B2Bi applications is far from trivial. Inter alia,agreement among integration partners about the business documents and the control flow of business document exchanges, applying suitable communication technologies for overcoming heterogeneous IT landscapes as well as ensuring a Quality of Service (QoS) level that is sufficient for B2Bi are major challenges.In this context, applying choreography languages like ebXML BPSS (ebBP) for agreement among integration partners, orchestration languages like WS-BPEL for specifying partner-specific behavior, and Web Services for communication promises seamless interactions among business partners. In this scenario, the conformance of orchestration models to choreography models and cost-effective development are of paramount importance.Consequently, top-down approaches that automatically translate choreography models into orchestration models have been proposed.By now, the realization of QoS attributes has not yet received the necessary attention that makes such approaches suitable for B2Bi. In this paper, we describe a proof-of-concept implementation of a translation of ebBP choreographies into WS-BPEL orchestrations that respects B2Bi relevant QoS attributes.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In thispaper, we present an incremental core bankingrenovation methodology based on the concept of businessentities. We implemented this methodology to develop anSOA solution to dynamic product bundling for an Asianbank. This renovation project provided an opportunity forus to explore SOA design principles regarding servicecomponent modularity, service reusability, changemanagement and integration, and also to empiricallydemonstrate the advantages of the business entity-centricapproach in achieving well-designed SOA solutions.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The interoperability it promised has made it more welcome than other integration technologies. However, web services may not be able to interact with one another directly due to interface mismatches. It happens when the service consumer and service provider have different message signatures. In this paper, we proposed an automatic interface adaptation approach that exploits ontology alignment tool. We propose a method that enables the interaction between WSDL described web service and semantic web services .We have also developed a method that extracts relevant semantic information from original annotation ontology to construct a compact ontology, in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of ontology alignment results.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233773,Performance Management for Large Scale Service Delivery Platforms.,"Managing performance of modern Service Delivery Platforms (SDPs) is a challenging task due to scale, dynamicity and heterogeneity of these systems. With the presence of a plethora of widely divergent applications, it becomes almost impossible to model these SDPs accurately enough for basic management tasks. The dynamicity of these platforms adds another dimension of complexity. Precisely due to these reasons, traditional learning based approaches are not adequate since these approaches are inherently very slow. In this paper, we present a novel technique for performance management in SDP environment to overcome these challenges. In our approach, we construct a multi-dimensional performance model grid called datagrid. Datagrid presents a unified management approach for various system management tasks such as provisioning, fault management and SLA management. According to our understanding, ours is a first system to have a unified approach for large scale SDP environments for multiple management tasks. We have implemented our technique in real distributed system and it shows promising results.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233774,Domain-Specific Deployment and Configuration Language for Composition and Adaptation of Coarse-Grained Services.,"Domain-specific languages promise an unprecedented integration of business and IT aspects in software development. This translates into a stronger focus on user requirements, higher adaptability, and shorter time-to-market. DSLs provide the opportunity to bring business actors and IT experts closer together by raising the mutual understanding of the models underpinning software development. A closer cooperation in modeling improves the understanding of systems and allows for experimentation. Business actors can identify their business processes and resources in the models and can experiment with them.This paper presents work-in-progress addressing a model layer for the dynamic composition and adaptation of coarse-grained web services through configuration information. Our domain-specific configuration language (DSCL) enables IT experts and business actors to concentrate on model representations that reflect individually tailored compositions of generic portal services. Our approach fosters modeling on two different levels of abstraction. Business actors define high-level models focusing on the definition of processes across coarse-grained services. Low-level concepts complete technical aspects that are abstracted away in high-level concepts.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233775,Interaction Mismatch Discovery Based Transformation from BPMN to BPEL.,"Many techniques have been proposed to transform BPMN into BPEL. The transformation for single BPMN process is studied well. But multiple BPMN processes often suffer from mismatch issues. This paper aims to better transform multiple BPMN processes containing interaction mismatches. The challenges for such trans-formation are: 1) ensuring transformed BPEL processes compatible 2) ensuring transformation interaction-preserved, which means keeping interactions those do not cause transformed processes mismatch preserved and transformed. In the paper, interaction mismatches are classified into two categories: static and runtime interaction mismatch. Both of them can be discovered by our approach based on interaction control-flow relations. For better transformation, discovered mismatch interactions are minimized and only the minimized result will not be transformed. A case study is given to illustrate the approach. The transformation also provides general support for transforming cross-organizational business processes into executable processes.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

However, a service may invoke other services offered by different providers forming composite services. The complex invocation relations significantly increase the complexity of trust evaluation in composite services. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for trust evaluation in composite services that takes all atomic invocations into account, which is essential for composite services selection and discovery.",2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1233777,Efficient Seat Utilization in Global IT Delivery Service Systems.,Rapidly growing service delivery organizations need efficient tools to manage their business and reduce the cost of growth. These delivery businesses run round the clock due to demands coming from different geographical locations for different shifts. Cost of adding new physical infrastructure and space to tap incoming business is a key inhibitor of growth. Physical space availability and its effective management is the key infrastructure enabler for effective business delivery apart from human resources. A considerable impact can be realized if space utilization can be increased by optimal allocation around different work shifts. Optimal space utilization can bring down the number of physical seats required to serve the existing demand and also allow service delivery organizations to commit to new business needs with the existing capacity. The paper addresses this business problem and proposes an effective seat utilization planning solution using a mathematical programming approach to meet various strategic and tactical business objectives in this setting.,2009,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1246145,Building Collaboration Applications that Mix Web Services Hosted Content with P2P Protocols.,"The most commonly deployed web service applications employ client-server communication patterns, with clients running remotely and services hosted in data centers. In this paper, we make the case for Service-Oriented Collaboration applications that combine service-hosted data with collaboration features implemented using peer-to-peer protocols. Collaboration features are awkward to support solely based on the existing web services technologies. Indirection through the data center introduces high latencies and limits scalability, and precludes collaboration between clients connected to one-another but lacking connectivity to the data center. Cornellâ€™s Live Distributed Objects platform combines web services with direct peer-to-peer communication to eliminate these issues.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246146,Applying Sanitizable Signature to Web-Service-Enabled Business Processes: Going Beyond Integrity Protection.,"This paper studies the scenario where data in business documents is aggregated by different entities via the use of web services in streamlined business processes. The documents are transported within the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) messages and travel through multiple intermediary entities, each potentially makes changes to the data in the documents. The WS-Security provides integrity protection by allowing portions of a SOAP message to be signed using eXtensible Markup Language (XML) signature scheme. This method however, has not considered the situation where a portion of data may be modified by another entity, therefore a need to allow the originating system to control which intermediary entity is authorized to change which portion of the data. The XML signature scheme also does not provide the final recipient the trust for the intermediary entity that makes the changes. In our paper, we study the security requirements for a streamlined business process, and proposes a novel scheme using sanitizable signature on SOAP messages to complement the XML signature to address not only integrity protection but also control of change as well as establishment of trust for intermediary entities. We show how the proposed scheme can be incorporated into the existing standards and be customizable to achieve flexible use of both the vanilla and sanitizable signatures as required in a business scenario. With the proposed technique, IT systems can be more loosely coupled and reap the benefits of distributed systems, such as delegation of work and encapsulation of business logic.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246147,An Abstraction Framework for Service Composition in Event-Driven SOA Systems.,"The three core problems that can be identified with any SOA based system are: (i) service discovery, (ii) service selection, and (iii) service composition. Most of the previous researches have considered these three problems separately. However, we argue that these three problems are intrinsically related and hence, cannot be treated separately. We propose a proactive event-driven model where user activities and services are treated as events. We then graphically model a SOA system into a network of activities called ""Activity Network"" (ANet). The nodes of such a network are the services and the edges their mutual causal dependency. We show how both functional as well as contextual information can be incorporated into the network and then justify why that is necessary for solving the three problems mentioned hereby. We then propose an abstraction technique that helps us to simplify the ANet and provide an architectural platform where the three problems can be solved in an efficient manner.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246148,Supporting Rebinding in BPEL.,"The idea of the future internet of services is to combine several services of numerous service providers to new value-added services or applications. To sell these services on so-called service marketplaces the providers have to ensure a high quality of service execution. But how could a provider of a composed service ensure the quality of the whole application, if single services of other providers fail or do not reach the required level of quality? This article describes an approach for modeling adaptation in web service compositions to ensure a guaranteed quality of service for the whole composite service. A special adaptation mechanism is the rebinding of single services while the process is executed if the services fail or could not reach the needed QoS level. We will present a solution for modeling these rebinding concepts in BPEL processes and the infrastructure to support this adaptation mechanism at run-time.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246149,An Approach to Non-functional Property Evaluation of Web Services.,"Web service evaluation is a phase of the Web service selection in which discovered Web services are evaluated with respect to user request, which means that the non functional properties (NFPs) offered by Web services are compared with the non functional properties requested by users. The fact that users and providers can express their NFPs in very flexible ways makes the management of NFPs a very complex task. In this paper we propose a computing-oriented description of NFPsand a novel approach to NFP-based service evaluation based on Hierarchical Constraint Logic Programming. This proposal extends our previous work on Policy Centered Meta-model (PCM).",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246150,Dynamic Collaborative Business Process Formulation via Ontologised Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) Planning.,"Increased trade and globalization has created an increasing need for the dynamic formulation and integration of cross-enterprise collaborative business processes (cBPâ€™s). However, current systems and methodologies, being static in nature, are unable to dynamically formulate cBPâ€™s based on business goals and selection criteria. Much of this stems from the current inability to bridge high level strategic business goals to low-level operational tasks, and the inability to dynamically decompose compound business process tasks into primitive operational tasks for direct Web service execution.In this paper, we demonstrate how the concepts from hierarchical task network (HTN) planning are feasible for dynamically creating cBP task sequences ideal for direct Web service execution. We also establish the rationale behind modeling business-to-business (B2B) collaboration tasks as hierarchical Web ontologies. To demonstrate the achievability of dynamic cBP formulation, we developed the Genesis methodology, which consists of (1) Business-OWL (BOWL) - a B2B hierarchical task Web ontology, and (2) the Genesis algorithm â€“ an extension of the hierarchical task network (HTN) planning algorithm to handle business criteria and control flows commonly found in business processes.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246151,The Fourth Party Service Platform and Service Charging.,"To solve the difficulties of the service operators on how to manage services and achieve a continuable operation goal, we propose and develop the 4th party service platform. We also develop a rule-based customizable charge service management component for the platform. The website www.foode.cn is the demonstration. The charging service is used to charge for the 3rd services such as search services, electronic authentication services, online communication services, online payment services and so on. The results show that the 4th party service platform can greatly shorten the construction time of a business application, reduce construction and operating costs, and enable service providers to share in the financial rewards properly.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246152,Out of the Confusion of Tongues: A Unified Database Programming Paradigm.,"Data-intensive applications are calling for (1) significant performance improvement in data processing, and (2) lowered entries for domain expertise to create higher value. Pursuing a database approach to the challenges, the paper presents an automated database extension mechanism, which allows one to seamlessly program application level workflows, and computations to be pushed down to (heterogeneous) database systems, in one programming language. We thus greatly ease the job of implementing scalable data intensive computations, with multiple databases as the computation platform.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246153,Service-Oriented Architecture for Privacy-Preserving Data Mashup.,"Mashup is a web technology that combines information from more than one source into a single web application.This technique provides a new platform for different data providers to flexibly integrate their expertise and deliver highly customizable services to their customers. None the-less, combining data from different sources could potentially reveal person-specific sensitive information. In this paper, we study and resolve a real-life privacy problem in a data mashup application for the financial industry in Swe-den. Therefore we propose a service-oriented architecture for privacy-preserving data mashup together with a multi-party protocol to securely integrate private data from different data providers, whereas the integrated data still retains the essential information for supporting general data exploration or a specific data mining task, such as classification analysis. Experiments on real-life data suggest that our proposed method is effective for simultaneously preserving both privacy and information usefulness.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246154,Deactivation of Unwelcomed Deep Web Extraction Services through Random Injection.,"Websites serve content both through Web Services as well as through user-viewable webpages. While the consumers of web-services are typically 'machines', webpages are meant for human users. It is highly desirable (for reasons of security, revenue, ownership, availability etc.) for service providers that content that will undergo further processing be fetched in a prescribed fashion, preferably through a supplied Web Services. In fact, monetization of partnerships within a services ecosystem normally means that website data translate into valuable revenue. Unfortunately, it is quite commonplace for arbitrary developers to extract or leverage information from websites without asking for permission and or negotiating a revenue sharing agreement. This may translate to significant lost income for content providers. Even in cases where website owners are happy to share the data, they may want users to adopt dedicated Web Service APIs (and associated API-servers) rather than putting a load on their revenue-generating websites. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism that disables automated web scraping agents, thus forcing clients to conform to the provided Web Services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246155,A Process Modeling-Based Approach for Web Service Management.,"Quality of individual services is substantial to guarantee high performance and availability of overall composite service oriented systems. This requires the process of diagnosing service quality degradation and responding to it in a timely and non-stopping manner. This paper presents a modeling-based approach to coordinate the process of Web service management, configuring parameters or invoking other tasks. This approach uses executable process models to represent diagnosis logic and orchestrate the replacement. The process models can interact with the system and accept administrators' instruction at the process level. As a result, a service can be automatically replaced by the best available strategy without any downtime of the overall system. Our approach is implemented on an architecture of Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) that allows intercepting services and redirecting messages with little performance penalty. The experiment demonstrates the efficiency of this approach using a loan-brokering Web service on ESB.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246156,SOA Middleware Support for Service Process Reconfiguration with End-to-End QoS Constraints.,"In SOA, services may become volatile and fail to deliver the quality of service as requested by users. In this paper, we present an approach for repairing failed services by replacing them with new services and ensuring the new service process still meets the user specified end-to-end QoS constraints. An iterative structural inspection algorithm is designed to produce reconfiguration regions that include one or more failed service. By reconfiguring only services in the selected regions, the business process will not be affected significantly. The algorithm may also utilize those available QoS constraints to relax the original constraints of a reconfiguration region and to provide more effective reconfiguration solutions. We also present the middleware components to support the service reconfiguration in the LLAMA framework.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246157,Towards a Model-Driven Process for Designing ReSTful Web Services.,"Representational State Transfer (ReST) architecture provides a set of constraints that drive design decisions towards architectural properties such as interoperability, evolvability and scalability. Designing a ReSTful service API involves finding resources and their relationships, selecting uniform operations for each resource, and defining data formats for them. It is often a non-trivial exercise to refine a functional specification, expressed in terms of arbitrary actions, to a resource-oriented, descriptive state information content. We argue that this process can be described as a series of model transformations, starting from service functionality and gradually refining the phase products until a ReSTful service API is reached. This paper outlines the process phases, transformations and intermediate models based on our experiences in developing ReSTful services and service APIs at Nokia Research Center. The process captures our understanding on how to systematically transform functional specifications into ReSTful Web service interfaces.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246158,The SCIFC Model for Information Flow Control in Web Service Composition.,"Existing web service access control models focus on individual web services, and do not consider service composition. In composite services, a major issue is information flow control. Critical information may flow from one service to another in a service chain through requests and responses and there is no mechanism for verifying that the flow complies with the access control policies. In this paper, we propose an innovative access control model to empower the services in a service chain to control the flow of their sensitive information. Our model supports information flow control through a back-check procedure and pass-on certificates. We also introduce additional factors such as the carry-along policy, security class, and transformation factor, to improve the protocol efficiency. A formal analysis is also presented to show the power and complexity of our protocol.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246159,Towards Adaptation of Service Interface Semantics.,"Interoperability promised by Web service makes it a most promising technology for the development of next generation distributed heterogeneous software systems. Services should be compliant at signature, behavioral and semantic level to make the interoperation successful and correct. Service adaptation provides an effective approach to bridge the incompatibility of services to make them interoperate as well as possible. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the definition of a methodology to develop adaptors that are capable of making two incompatible services interoperate not only successfully but also correctly at semantic level. To achieve this goal, we proposed service specifications for both atomic and composite services with semantic dependency between outputs and inputs specified; then we proposed adaptor specification consisting of three parts, which are message mapping, action mapping and treatment for non-mapping messages. Based on service and adaptor specifications, an incremental derivation approach of a concrete adaptor is given.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246160,Towards Probabilistic Estimation of Quality of Online Services.,"Accurate estimation of quality of online services is both an important and difficult problem, since a service has many interdependent quality attributes influenced by several contextual factors. It is even more challenging as quality ratings come from sources with unknown reliability,each source may rate a service on different quality aspects.Although several solutions have been proposed, there is little work addressing all these issues thoroughly. In this paper, we show that domain knowledge on service structure and related constraints, such as causal dependencies among quality attributes and contextual factors, while widely available, can be exploited to effectively address the above issues in a theoretically-sound framework. Theoretical analysis shows that computational cost of the approach is acceptable, and accurate evaluation of service quality requires a reasonable number of user feedback, provided services have a small number of quality attributes and contextual factors.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

This paper describes the OPUCE service and component repository, which extends the OMA OSPE service model storage approach XDM. By integrating an ebXML Registry using the native notification mechanisms of XDM, the search capability of the repository is dramatically improved. Moreover, this repository also exploits semantic Web technology to provide an intuitive visualized browser for convenient service exploring.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246162,Rapid Identification Approach for Reusable SOA Assets Using Component Business Maps.,"Substantial savings from asset reuse result when the right assets are identified in the very early stages of a client engagement.Unfortunately, advanced identification approaches (known by having high precision and recall, such as behavior-based approaches)cannot be adopted in these early stages,because at these early stages, there is no many details nor much understanding about the client functional requirements. On the other hand, unstructured keyword-based identification approaches are known of having low precision and recall. To overcome this problem, we argue that assets descriptions should have explicit information about the business activities realized by the assets. To be able to capture this information in a machine understandable format, this paper proposes a model for describing reusable assets functional scopes using Component Business Maps (CBMs), in which the asset scope is represented as a hierarchy of CBM elements. Adopting this scope model, the paper proposes a rapid identification approach for reusable assets that retrieves assets based on their CBM projections. We believe the proposed approach provides better precision and recall when compared to unstructured keyword-based approaches.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246163,DHT-Based Range Query Processing for Web Service Discovery.,"DHTs are scalable, self-organizing, and adaptive to underlying topology changes, thus being a promising infrastructure for realizing efficient Web service discovery. Range queries play an important role in service discovery, and in recent years a number of DHT-based range query schemes have been proposed. However, most of them suffer from high query delay and high processing cost. This paper presents ERQ, an Efficient scheme for delay bounded Range Query processing over DHTs. We first emulate the PHT structure and design a balanced Kautz (BK) tree to uniformly map the m-dimensional data space onto DHT nodes, and then present a novel algorithm that processes range queries in a parallel fashion, where an on-the-fly space pruning mechanism is adopted to reduce the processing cost. In a DHT with N nodes, ERQ can answer any range query in less than logN (2loglogN+1) hops with low processing cost, irrespective of the queried range, the whole space size, or the number of queried attributes. The effectiveness of ERQ is demonstrated through extensive experiments.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246164,Composing Services for Third-party Service Delivery.,"This paper proposes a model-based technique for lowering the entrance barrier for service providers to register services with a marketplace broker, such that the service is rapidly configured to utilize the brokerâ€™s local service delivery management components. Specifically, it uses process modeling for supporting the execution steps of a service and shows how service delivery functions (e.g. payment points) â€œlocalâ€ù to a service broker can be correctly configured into the process model. By formalizing the different operations in a service delivery function (like payment or settlement) and their allowable execution sequences (full payments must follow partial payments), including cross-function dependencies, it shows how through tool support, the non-technical user can quickly configure service delivery functions in a consistent and complete way.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246165,Using Model Customization for Variability Management in Service Compositions.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is currently supported by an infrastructure that facilitates model driven development, but reuse issues have received less attention. A key problem in reuse is variability management: how to support the specification and usage of the variation points of the system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-level variability management, assuming UML activity diagrams as the notation for service composition models in SOA. The approach is based on specifying variation points using so-called specialization patterns, which have been originally developed to support task-driven specialization of application frameworks. We demonstrate the approach with a prototype tool and an example. The approach leads to a guided model customization process focusing on the variation points, making it easy to produce a variant of a basic model.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246166,A Framework for Building Reliable Distributed Bioinformatics Service Repositories.,"The reliability is a major factor that limits the success of promising service oriented architecture in bioinformatics. To evaluate services reliability and availability and create indicators of quality of service, we have defined an XML format designed to exchange service status reports. We demonstrate the interest of sharing status reports between service consumers and producers by providing two example applications, a workflow management system plug-in and a web report generator. Furthermore, we describe the framework that we use to distribute quality of service management features, QBIOS. QBIOS enables service test case creation, scheduled execution and monitoring. We illustrate the use of our open test strategy at the level of a group of scientific partners sharing bioinformatics services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246167,User-Perceived Service Availability: A Metric and an Estimation Approach.,"Web-service-related techniques have become popular to improve system integration and interaction. In distributed and dynamic environment, web services' availability has been regarded as one of the key properties for (critical) service-oriented applications. Quality of Service (QoS), including availability, has been regarded by IEEE as a user-perceived property. However, based on our investigation of monitoring invocation records of real web services, existing availability metrics, which were proposed in traditional domains, have not addressed the ""user-perceived'' characteristics. Based on analyzing the limitations of the existing availability metrics, we propose a status-based user-perceived service availability metric and a corresponding estimation approach. Experiments on monitoring and analyzing the invocation records of real services demonstrate that the new metric and the corresponding estimation approach could lead to a feasible estimationon web services' availability from the user side.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246168,A Semantic Repository for Geological Modeling Workflows.,"Nowadays, many engineering studies are conducted to securely exploit depleted Oil Fields for CO2 Storage.These studies follow complex workflows of data processing services described by geologists. If no explicit semantics is applied to describe these workflows, it is not possible to share them between geologists by reusing existing ones or for composing new ones. The focus of our work is to make the semantics explicit in order to facilitate the geologists daily work. In this article, we first explain how geologists operate today. Then, we enrich such workflows with semantic indexes through ontology based characterizations.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246169,Efficient Testing of Service-Oriented Applications Using Semantic Service Stubs.,"Service-oriented applications can be expensive to test because services are hosted remotely, are potentially shared among many users, and may have costs associated with their invocation. In this paper, we present an approach for reducing the costs of testing such applications. The key observation underlying our approach is that certain aspects of an application can be tested using locally deployed semantic service stubs, instead of actual remote services.A semantic service stub incorporates some of the service functionality, such as verifying preconditions and generating output messages based on post conditions. We illustrate how semantic stubs can enable the client test suite to be partitioned into subsets, some of which need not be executed using remote services. We also present a case study that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach, and potential cost savings for testing. The main benefits of our approach are that it can (1) reduce the number of test cases that need to be run to invoke remote services, (2) ensure that certain aspects of application functionality are well-tested before service integration occurs.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246170,Service Supervision: Coordinating Web Services in Open Environment.,"A composite Web service designed based on abstract Web services, which define only interfaces, allows an application developer to select services required for his application only by setting endpoints for the atomic Web services. In open environment, however, the composite Web service configured in this manner may fail due to unique behaviors of the selected services. It is difficult for the designer of the composite Web service to prevent the failure because he does not know which services are selected and how they behave. On the other hand, the application developer is not authorized to modify the composite Web service due to the need to protect intellectual rights. Our solution is Service Supervision, which monitors and controls execution of composite Web services. Service Supervision makes the followings possible. 1) An application developer can control the behavior of a composite Web service by changing the execution state, even if the he is not authorized to modify the composite Web services. 2) A control pattern for coordinating Web services can be applied to various composite Web services in order to reduce the load imposed by designing control processes. In order to realize Service Supervision, we introduce meta-level control of a composite Web service. Moreover we then use the choreography to define the interaction protocols for the controls. The proposed framework is based on existing standard languages, WS-BPEL and WS-CDL. Therefore we can exploit existing tools and expertise of SOA engineers.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246171,Scenario-Driven Approach for Business Process Modeling.,"The development of services-based systems starts from defining goals for businessprocesses to be implemented, e.g., as a Web service orchestrations specified in WS-BPEL. In this paper, we propose a scenario-driven approach for modeling business processes. We aim for simplicity in the notation and leverage example-like modeling principles in order to improve process sketching. The first step in our approach is to identify the essential business requirements and model themusing a simple scenario notation. The scenarios, given as UML sequence diagrams, are synthesized into a state machine, which is translated into a WS-BPEL flavored process skeleton given as UML activity diagram. The process skeleton can be further refined into executable process model.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246172,Contract-First Design Techniques for Building Enterprise Web Services.,"Based on real development experience, the paper presents a collection of design techniques for building enterprise web services. By applying the techniques to web services development, not only the development increases reusability and productivity, but also the web services improve agility and compatibility.Enterprise web services require high grade of competency in designing web service contracts. A contract of web service formalizes an agreement between web service provider and consumer, in the forms of WSDLs, service schemas and policies. Though contract-first method provides great potential of directly dealing with the contracts, and a number of articles have been published regarding designing WS and XML schemas, however it is still hard for developers to find cookbooks or guidelines concentrated on designing web service contracts with contract-first method. To fill the gap, a set of design techniques are introduced and deployed in practice, incorporating some best practices scattered over the web services community. These techniques cover most of the key aspects of web service, including consolidating service schemas in line with business entities, constructing coarse-grained namespaces, applying versioning over WSDLs and service schemas, and writing fine-grained filters with contracts.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246173,Web Service Mashup Middleware with Partitioning of XML Pipelines.,"Traditionally, the composition of Web services to create mashups has been achieved by using an application server as a mediator between a client browser and services. To avoid this bottleneck, mashups are sometimes implemented so that Web service composition takes place directly from the end userâ€™s browser. Creating such implementations is difficult because developers must manage the separation of software into various distributable pieces, in different languages, and coordinate their communication. In this paper we describe a middleware for managing Web service mashups in a disciplined, and flexible way. We build upon the established abstraction of XML pipelines, but describe a new approach for selectively partitioning pipeline components between a browser client and application server. We provide a performance evaluation for a common mashup application scenario.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246174,Exploiting Metrics for Similarity-Based Semantic Web Service Discovery.,"Semantic Web Services (SWS) aim at the automated discovery and orchestration of Web services on the basis of comprehensive, machine-interpretable semantic descriptions. However, heterogeneities between distinct SWS representations pose strong limitations w.r.t. interoperability and reusability. Hence, semantic level mediation, i.e. mediation between concurrent semantic representations, is a key requirement to allow SWS matchmaking algorithms to compare capabilities of distinct SWS. In that, semantic level mediation requires to identify similarities across distinct SWS representations. Since current approaches to mediate between distinct service annotations rely either on manual one-to-one mappings or on semi-automatic mappings based on the exploitation of linguistic or structural similarities, these are perceived to be costly and error-prone. We propose a mediation approach enabling the implicit representation of similarities across distinct SWS by grounding these in so-called Mediation Spaces (MS). Given a set of SWS and their respective MS grounding, a general-purpose mediator automatically computes similarities to identify the most appropriate SWS for a given request. A prototypical application illustrates our approach.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246175,Establishing and Monitoring SLAs in Complex Service Based Systems.,"In modern service economies, service provisioning needs to be regulated by complex SLA hierarchies among providers of heterogeneous services, defined at the business, software, and infrastructure layers. Starting from the SLA Management framework defined in the SLA@SOI EU FP7 Integrated Project, we focus on the relationship between establishment and monitoring of such SLAs, showing how the two processes become tightly interleaved in order to provide meaningful mechanisms for SLA management. We first describe the process for SLA establishment adopted within the framework; then,we propose an architecture for monitoring SLAs, which satisfies the two main requirements introduced by SLA establishment: the availability of historical data for evaluating SLA offers and the assessment of the capability to monitor the terms in a SLA offer.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246176,Formal Analysis for Multimedia Conferencing Communication Services Orchestration.,"Service-oriented communication (SOC) is a new trend in the industry to enable communication through a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and thereby encapsulate communication capabilities as services. In this paper, we design the session initiation protocol (SIP) based multimedia conferencing communication services model, And mainly focus on formal analysis for BPEL based multimedia conferencing communication services orchestration and to guarantee the process correctness for such applications, and also providing an automated support for the formal analysis model of their behavior. Finally, we give the conclusions.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246177,Identity Attribute-Based Role Provisioning for Human WS-BPEL Processes.,"The WS-BPEL specification focuses on business processes the activities of which are assumed to be interactions with Web services. However, WS-BPEL processes go beyond the orchestration of activities exposed as Web services. There are cases in which people must be considered as additional participants to the execution of a process. The inclusion of humans, in turn, requires solutionsto support the specification and enforcement of authorizations to users for the execution of human activities while enforcing authorization constraints.In this paper, we extend RBAC-WS-BPEL, a role-based authorization framework for WS-BPEL processes with an identity attribute-based role provisioning approach that preserves the privacy of the users who claim the execution of human activities. Such approach is based on the notion of identity records and role provisioning policies, and uses Pedersen commitments, aggregated zero knowledge proof of knowledge, andOblivious Commitment-Based Envelope protocols to achieve privacy of user identity information.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246178,Design of SOA Based Web Service Systems Using QFD for Satisfaction of Quality of Service Requirements.,"Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a loosely-coupled architecture designed to meet business needs of an organization. It is becoming a trend for system development and integration where systems group functionality around business processes. Although SOA does not require Web services, Web services are based on accepted standards and drive SOA to the mainstream.There are at least two challenges with quality management of SOA based Web service systems. One of them is how to link explicitly its technical capabilities with customersâ€™ needs to satisfy customersâ€™ functional and nonfunctional requirements. The second is how to determine targets of Web service technical attributes. The first issue is not addressed at all and the second issue is dealt with subjectively in the current practice of development of SOA based web service systems. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) is a major quality management system used to determine product development characteristics from customer requirements. It has found its success in improving quality of complex products, such as automobiles, aircrafts, and consumer electronics, although it has not been used in the development of SOA based Web service systems. In this paper, we analyze a number of quality of Web service requirements and their related technical attributes, and apply the QFD for developing SOA based Web service systems by linking quality of service requirements to Web service design attributes. An impact based linear regression method is used to determine technical targets of design features of SOA based Web service systems for the satisfaction of quality of service requirements.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246179,Improving Web Services Robustness.,"Developing robust web services is a difficult task. Field studies show that a large number of web services are deployed with robustness problems (i.e., presenting unexpected behaviors in the presence of invalid inputs). Several techniques for the identification of robustness problems have been proposed in the past. This paper proposes a mechanism that automatically fixes the problems detected. The approach consists of using robustness testing to detect robustness issues and then mitigate those issues by applying inputs verification based on well-defined parameter domains, including domain dependencies between different parameters. This integrated and fully automatable methodology has been used to improve three different implementations of the TPC-App web services. Results show that this tool can be easily used by developers to improve the robustness of web services implementations.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246180,SAWSDL-MX2: A Machine-Learning Approach for Integrating Semantic Web Service Matchmaking Variants.,"In this paper, we present SAWSDL-MX2, a hybrid semantic Web service matchmaker for SAWSDL services. Building on our initial work in \cite{Klu_Kap_08}, we adopt logic-based as well astext similarity service selection for model references and add a structural approach from \cite{Zin_Rup_Fis_06}, which operates on the pure syntactic description of WSDL elements. The integration of these matching variants is accomplished using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with non-linear kernel, thus automatically adapting an aggregation function based on previously experienced training data. Results of our performance evaluation based on the standard measures recall and precision over the SAWSDL-TC1 test collection as well as an exhaustive example for all basic matching variants are also given.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246181,Dynamo + Astro: An Integrated Approach for BPEL Monitoring.,"In the literature, there exist several approaches for monitoring the execution of BPEL processes. They concentrate on different properties, adopt different languages, work at different levels of abstraction, and assume different perspectives. Even if the field is rather new, we do not think that this diversity is a limitation of current solutions; rather it is intrinsic in the problem itself. We claim that, instead of working on the definition of the ultimate approach for BPEL monitoring, we should push a cooperative approach based on the integration of different solutions.In this paper, we present a first step in this direction, and describe a monitoring framework which is obtained by integrating two well-known approaches, namely Dynamo and Astro. This integration, which happens both for the language used for expressing the properties to be monitored, and for the architecture of the monitoring framework, allows to combine the advantages of the two approaches and to obtain a general, comprehensive solutions for BPEL monitoring.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246182,A Relational Approach for Ef?cient Service Selection.,"Web services are gaining momentum asa major vehicle to deliver business functionalities on the Web. More and more business organizations have begun to use Web services to facilitate user interactions and the collaboration among themselves. This essentially forms a large service space, which still keeps growing. Meanwhile, there may be functionality overlaps among different service providers. The concept of Quality of Web Service (QoWS) is emerging as a key feature in distinguishing between competing service providers. We present in this paper a systematic approach for efficient service selection by using QoWS as the major criterion. In particular, we adopt a relational approach that enables to store QoWS information in a relational DBMS and leverage standard relational operators for efficient service selection. We perform a preliminary set of experiments to evaluate the proposed service selection algorithms.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246183,WSRec: A Collaborative Filtering Based Web Service Recommender System.,"As the abundance of Web services on the World Wide Web increase,designing effective approaches for Web service selection and recommendation has become more and more important. In this paper, we present WSRec, a Web service recommender system, to attack this crucial problem. WSRec includes a user-contribution mechanism for Web service QoS information collection and an effective and novel hybrid collaborative filtering algorithm for Web service QoS value prediction. WSRec is implemented by Java language and deployed to the real-world environment. To study the prediction performance, A total of 21,197 public Web services are obtained from the Internet and a large-scale real-world experiment is conducted, where more than 1.5 millions test results are collected from 150 service users in different countries on 100 publicly available Web services located all over the world. The comprehensive experimental analysis shows that WSRec achieves better prediction accuracy than other approaches.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246184,Virtualizing Services and Resources with ProBus: The WS-Policy-Aware Service and Resource Bus.,"A fundamental principle of service oriented architectures is the decoupling of service requesters and service providers to enable late binding of services at deployment time or even dynamic binding of services at runtime.This is important in enterprise settings, where different services that implement business functions in critical business processes are dynamically chosen based on availability or price. The same problem also applies to dynamic Grid environments where resources need to be dynamically chosen based on availability and other non-functional properties. The WS-Policy framework describes how policies for both providers and requesters are specified to allow the selection of services based on these policies. Existing approaches, using WS-Policy,have drawbacks by placing the burden of the service selection partially on the client. In this paper we present an extended enterprise service bus that allows service clients to submit policies to which service providers need to comply with together in one message with the service invocation request. We show how these policies are evaluated in the bus and how policies are defined for not only stateless services, but also stateful resources.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246185,A Policy-Based Middleware for Web Services SLA Negotiation.,"Negotiation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) is very important for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) of composite Web services-based business processes. The process of negotiation involves specification of negotiation parameters, exchanging offers to conduct the actual negotiation process, and then finally generating the formal SLA if the negotiating parties come to a consensus. We propose a Negotiation Broker (NB) middleware framework to facilitate automated negotiations of SLAs for Web services in a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). High level business goals, contexts, preferences, constraints, and values of the negotiation issues are expressed as a policy specification by each of the negotiating parties. The NB maps the policy specifications to low level negotiation strategy models and parameters in order to conduct the negotiation locally as a trusted broker. We present a model and an example of the high level negotiation policy specification. We also present our NB framework including a prototype implementation to illustrate the mapping of the policy to a time-dependent negotiation strategy model.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246186,CCOA: Cloud Computing Open Architecture.,"Cloud Computing is evolving as a key computing platform for sharing resources that include infrastructures, software, applications, and business processes. Virtualization is a core technology for enabling cloud resource sharing. However, most existing Cloud Computing platforms have not formally adopted the service-oriented architecture (SOA) that would make them more flexible, extensible, and reusable. By bridging the power of SOA and virtualization in the context of Cloud Computing ecosystem, this paper presents seven architectural principles and derives ten interconnected architectural modules to form a reusable and customizable Cloud Computing Open Architecture (CCOA). Two case studies on Infrastructure and Business Cloud are used to deliver business and practical value of infrastructure and business process provisioning services over the Internet. We also present some potential value-added services of the proposed CCOA to guide strategic planning and other consulting practices of Cloud Computing.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246187,Flexible Probabilistic QoS Management of Transaction Based Web Services Orchestrations.,"In this paper we extend our previous work on soft probabilistic contracts for QoS management, from the particular case of ""response time"", to general QoS parameters. Our study covers composite QoS parameters dealing not only with time aspects but also with Quality of Data. We also study contract composition (how to derive QoS contracts for an orchestration from the QoS contracts with its called services), and contract monitoring. Our approach supports comprehensive and flexible QoS management within a probabilistic framework.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246188,Pat: A P2P Based Publish/Subscribe System for QoS Information Dissemination of Web Services.,"A fundamental problem that confronts QoS-aware service selection and composition is the efficient and timely QoS information obtainment. Current research on this problem usually involves query-based or monitoring-based methods. However, in a dynamic and volatile service oriented Computing (SOC) environment, these solutions suffer some or all of the limitations, such as cost, timeliness guarantee and salability. This paper presents Pat, a P2P based publish/subscribe system to disseminate new revised QoS information. Pat aims at reliable and efficient QoS information dissemination in large-scale SOC environments. It exploits specialized rendezvous points (RP) and a replicas mechanism to reduce the risk of subscriptions loss and consequently improve reliability. A reverse RP ring is designed to quicken subscription delivery and QoS information publication. In addition, an optimization mechanism for composite services is built into Pat, which helps to reduce notification traffic. Simulation results show that Pat is reliable, efficient and scalable.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246189,Wrap Scientific Applications as WSRF Grid Services Using gRAVI.,"Web service models are increasingly being used in the Grid community as way to create distributed applications exposing data and/or applications through self describing interfaces. Scientific research is one key field in which the benefits are apparent as individual services can be orchestrated into experimental workflows that model the research process and facilitate verification and extension. However, many applications are not web enabled and the task of creating services from scratch is cumbersome in part due to the range of complex technologies, tools, standards and languages involved. In this paper we present gRAVI, a WSRF Web service wrapping tool that allows scientists to rapidly expose applications, scripts and workflows as Web services. gRAVI generated services include GSI security, Grid scheduling, state notifications, persistence and data staging. All service code, scripts and definition files are created automatically without any developer input. gRAVI services are created in standard Grid Archive files and are able to be moved and deployed to any compliant container with no requirement for any gRAVI or Grid infrastructure on the target machine. gRAVI supports deployment to the open science cloud Nimbus, whilst also being able to parse Taverna workflow definition files to create strongly typed services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246190,A Performance Evaluation Study for Web Services Attachments.,"Web Services are a technology based on the Service Oriented Architecture that enables communication between applications through the Internet. Using Web Services, it is possible to send any type of information in any form of encryption. In this context, different techniques have been used to attach binary files in SOAP messages. However, there is no consensus on which technique has the best performance. This paper presents a performance evaluation study with three techniques for Web Service attachments: Pure Binary, MTOM and SwA. A testing environment was configured to verify the influence of the network and the size of files. Also, we present a tool called WSATPerf that supports the execution of the performance evaluation.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246191,Behavioral Attestation for Business Processes.,"Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural paradigm that enables dynamic composition of heterogeneous, independent, multi-vendor business services. A prerequisite for such inter-organizational workflows is the establishment of trustworthiness, which is mostly achieved through non-technical measures such as legislation, and/or social consent that businesses, or organizations simply pledge themselves to adhere. In our viewpoint, a business process can only be trustworthy if the behavior of all services in it is trustworthy. Trusted Computing Group (TCG) has defined an open set of specifications for the establishment of trustworthiness through a hardware root-of-trust. This paper has three objectives: firstly, the behavior of individual services in a business process is formally specified. Secondly, in order to overcome the inherent weaknesses of trust management through software alone, a hardware root of-trust devised by the TCG, is used for the measurement of the behavior of individual services in a business process. Finally, a verification mechanism is detailed through which the trustworthiness of a business process can be verified.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246192,Analytic Architecture Assessment in SOA Solution Design and its Engineering Application.,"In this paper, we present an architecture-centric assessment approach for model evaluation over reference architecture to quantitatively estimate architecture maturity and quality. Such assessment is essential to support design-level refinement for an enterprise solution. To achieve this analytic goal, we select a nine-layer SOA solution stack (S3) as reference architecture, and introduce the necessary mathematical definitions and formulation. The baseline for such assessment is a model template composed of S3 solution patterns. A template is the starting point of creating a design model. The selection of such template will largely determine the architecture properties of the final SOA solution.The maturity analysis is carried out at different granularity levels (architecture building block, architecture layer, and architecture model) to justify the â€˜completenessâ€™ of a design. The quality assessment is accomplished through a set of quality-indicators to justify the â€˜goodnessâ€™ of an architecture based on the relationships of architecture building block instances. Finally, using UML 2.0 to capture the model of S3, we provide a real assessment prototype developed over IBM RSA platform.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246193,An Extensible Abstract Service Orchestration Framework.,"Service composition is complex. It has to reach a set of pre-defined non-functional qualities, like security for instance, which requires the production of complicated code.This code, often distributed between client and server sides, is highly error-prone and difficult to maintain. In this paper, we present a generative environment for the orchestration of abstract services and the separate specification of non-functional properties. This environment has been built within the European SODA project and validated on several industrial use cases. In this paper, we focus on an alarm management scenario with stringent security requirements.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246194,Selective Querying for Adapting Hierarchical Web Service Compositions Using Aggregate Volatility.,"Environments in which Web service compositions (WSC)operate are often dynamic. We address the problem of which service to query for up-to-date information in order to adapt a hierarchical WSC, given that queries are not free. Previously,the value of changed information (VOC) has been proposed to select those services for querying whose revised non-functional information is expected to bring about the most change in the composition. In this paper, we present an approach for utilizing VOC in the context of a WSC composed of services and lower level WSCs, which induces a natural hierarchy over the composition.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246195,Enabling Scaleable Efficient Non-visual Web Browsing Services.,"Over the last few decades, the discipline of Web Accessibility has been focused on building more efficient and more effective speech generators for Web Browsers. The visual browser interface is central to the current paradigm. However, in many cases, visual interaction is not required or desired, e.g. it is not relevant for blind people. More generally, when the input and output points are WAV files, SMS messages or natural queries, it becomes very clear that going through the visual user interface is overkill. In this paper we introduce a solution to this problem - a scalable, efficient, non-visual web browser that works with a Web whose central assumption is that visual interaction is an integral part of the user experience.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246196,Research on WS-Management-based System and Network Resource Management Middleware Model.,"Nowadays, system and network resource management software should deal with more and more heterogeneous specific interfaces of different resource. This is a tightly-coupled management model. Recent years, Web Services have become the major technology and architecture of SOA for enterprise applications. Web Services provides a loosely-coupled management model. In this paper, based on the Web Services-based management protocol-WSManagement, we propose the distributed System and Network Resource Management Middleware Model. In this model, every managed IT resource provides the manageability interfaces via WS-Management specification. Furthermore, we utilize WSManagement Java implementation prototype-wiseman and WMI management interface to carry out the scheme implementation and test case work of the novel model, and then analyze the experiment results. At last, we analyze the prospective research direction and challenges in this field.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246197,GroupSpeak: High-level Language Extension for Workflow Capability.,"Currently, workflow systems are either XML based or component based. Both paradigms have usability deficiencies. XML is not designed for procedural programming. Legacy code is difficult to adapt to component based systems. We propose a new paradigm by adding workflow keywords to an existing high-level language. This approach, called GroupSpeak, uses a procedural style of programming and allows for easy introduction of workflow patterns to legacy code. The programmer can leverage their existing knowledge of the high-level language to easily add workflow capabilities to their applications.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246198,Applying Knowledge Sharing for Business Intelligence Collaboration.,"IT services need an automatic and flexible ability to react to dynamic changes in their environment. Managing change effectively and reducing the negative effects of day-to-day operations has become one of the most important tasks in IT service management, which require hiring highly skilled IT professionals with correspondingly high labor costs. There is a challenge to select, implement and integrate the right resources quickly and effectively. Although there is a growing body of research into IT management, many techniques are either too narrow (focusing on a single component rather than the entire system), or they address only configuration data collection and integration. Instead, one needs to scale or respond to special domain knowledge, collaboration and the right data for helping IT professionals to improve their work. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-sharing based collaborating management system for IT service management. It aims to bridge the gap between domain expertsâ€™ knowledge and manageable systems. We developed a proof-of-concept of an impact analysis service based on knowledge-sharing; it establishes an IT service management collaboration paradigm and ecosystem, leveraging the expertâ€™s rich knowledge and experience to improve the management quality and reduce the cost. A case study driven by customers demonstrates that collaboration with knowledge sharing is effective both at constructing useful system analysis services and in using those services to improve system management.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246199,The Web Service Browser: Automatic Client Generation and Efficient Data Transfer for Web Services.,"Web services are supported by almost all major software vendors, but nevertheless there is still a certain barrier that prevents a broader user community to actually use them. The barrier is the lack of appropriate clients offered in conjunction with the services. This paper presents a Web Service Browser that automatically generates a dynamic user interface when the user browses to the location of the service description and additionally handles the invocation of the service. To ease the use of the service, the browser takes care of data management by using an implementation of the Flex-SwA architecture. Results are presented to the user in a human-readable manner. When the result contains multimedia data, an audio or video player is used to present the result. Use cases demonstrate the benefits of the browser. With the Web Service Browser, web services simply become a usable component offered in the WWW.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246200,Service Provenance in QoS-Aware Web Service Runtimes.,"In general, provenance of electronic data represents an important issue in information systems. So far, Service-oriented Computing research has mainly focused on provenance of data. However, service provenance also plays a central role since service providers and consumers want to be aware of the service's origin and history. In this paper, we present an approach for service provenance that builds on service metadata and various service runtime events. In addition, access control mechanisms are implemented to restrict access to this information. Besides being able to query and subscribe to provenance information, provenance graphs can be used to illustrate the history of services. We give some usage examples of service provenance and show how our approach was integrated into the VRESCo Web service runtime environment.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246201,An Approach to Composing Web Services with Context Heterogeneity.,"The potential benefits of Web services composition heavily rely on semantic interoperability, i.e., the ability to exchange data meaningfully amongst Web services. Context heterogeneity, which refers to different implicit assumptions about interpreting the exchanged data, hampers the automatic composition of Web services. However, existing initiatives of Semantic Web Services (SWSs) often ignore context heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce an approach to address this issue. The contexts of the involved Web services are defined in a lightweight ontology and their WSDL descriptions are annotated by an extension of a W3C standard, i.e., Semantic Annotation for WSDL and XML Schema (SAWSDL). The composition of Web services is described using BPEL specification. Given a BPEL file that ignores context heterogeneity, the approach automatically detects all context differences among the involved services, and reconciles them by producing a mediated BPEL file that incorporates necessary conversions using XPath functions and/or Web services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246202,Change Detection and Correction Facilitation for Web Applications and Services.,"There are a large number of websites serving valuable content that can be used by higher-level applications, Web Services, Mashups, etc. Yet, due to various reasons (lack of computing resources, financial constraints etc.) they are unable to provide Web Service APIs to access their data. In their desire to incorporate the latest and greatest technologies, as well as to adapt layouts that are more preferred by users, websites undergo changes over time. These changes can range from minor, e.g. function name changes, to major, e.g., shifting the web platform to AJAX technologies. This paper addresses the problem of detecting layout changes for websites which are unable to provide any Web Service to access their content, yet do not mind others harvesting said content.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246203,A Tool for Choreography Analysis Using Collaboration Diagrams.,"Analyzing interactions among peers that interact via messages is a crucial problem due to increasingly distributed nature of current software systems, especially the ones built using the service oriented computing paradigm. In service oriented computing, interactions among peers participating to a composite service involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment. In order to build such systems in a reliable manner, it is necessary to develop techniques for analysis and verification of interactions among services. Collaboration diagrams provide a convenient visual model for modeling service interactions. In this paper, we present a tool that 1) checks the realizability of interactions specified by the given collaboration diagram, 2) verifies the LTL properties of the interactions specified by the given collaboration diagram by automatically converting it to a state machine model, and 3) synthesizes peer state machines that realize the set of interactions specified by the given collaboration diagram.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

1246205,SOA-Based Integration of the Internet of Things in Enterprise Services.,"Advances in the areas of embedded systems, computing, and networking are leading to an infrastructure composed of millions of heterogeneous devices. These devices will not simply convey information but process it in transit, connect peer to peer, and form advanced collaborations. This ``Internet of Things'' infrastructure will be strongly integrated with the environment, and its integration with the enterprise systems will not only further blur the line between business IT systems and the real world, but will change the way we design, deploy, and use services. New opportunities can emerge for businesses, which can now closely collaborate with the real world. The work presented here proposes an architecture for an effective integration of the Internet of Things in enterprise services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246206,Service Composition as Generative Constraint Satisfaction.,"The ability to build new (complex) services by composing existingservices is one of the key benefits of the Service Oriented Architectureparadigm. Existing approaches to automate composition requirespre-planning or prediction of the number of required services, makingthem unsuitable in dynamic composition scenarios. To address this gap, wepresent a consistency-based service composition approach, wherecomposition problems are modeled in a generative constraint-basedformalism. We illustrate how the configuration of service processesdiffers from established constraint-based configuration techniques anddevelop an algorithm to synthesis valid service process compositions. Wealso show that our technique scales well to non-trivial problems.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246207,Mobile In-store Personalized Services.,"The Mobile Shopping Assistant (MSA) is a mobile application platform to deliver real-time, in-store, and personalized services, such as personalized product offerings and in-store customer advisory support, to improve the shopping experiences of in-store customers. The service delivery network that powers the MSA involves retail stores and their business partners such as manufacturers. This paper presents the core technologies that we developed in this cross-organizational service network to support the MSA and its personalized services, with focus on service delivery, customer behavior understanding and information sharing. Our event-based techniques allow customers, stores and manufacturers to deliver and consume the services in a loosely coupled manner, thus solving a critical store-specific real-time engagement problem in a seamless way. Service response tracking enables the stores to construct a comprehensive view of a customerâ€™s in-store shopping behavior. Finally, the cross-organizational authorization-based access control mechanism effectively enforces information sharing between the stores and their partners.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246208,A Contract-Based Accountability Service Model.,"As growing number of real-world activities are performed through Internet connected services, there are increasing needs to make the behaviors of both service consumer and provider accountable. Many efforts attempting to regulate services and to guarantee service qualities lack sufficient accountability support. This paper treats accountability as a service and proposes a novel contract-based accountability service model to tackle this problem. The model uses federated accountability services to audit interactions between service consumers and service providers so that misbehaviors can be detected with undeniable evidences. We show how Internet data management services can be made accountable using this service model. We implemented the data management service and characterized its performance.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246209,Patterns for Enterprise Mashups in B2B Collaborations to Foster Lightweight Composition and End User Development.,"The huge demand for situational and ad-hoc applications desired by the mass of business end users cannot be fully implemented by IT departments. New approaches that allow for End User Development (EUD) are needed to overcome this â€œlong-tailâ€ù dilemma. More specifically,most existing approaches insufficiently support EUD for infrequent, situational, and ad-hoc B2B Collaborations.Enterprise Mashup-/ and Lightweight Composition approaches and tools are promising solutions to unleash the huge potential of integrating the mass of users into development. Within the current research project FAST,a Web based Mashup/ Gadget development tool is in development that allows for different options to realizeB2B collaborations via Mashups. In this work, five patterns for the development of Enterprise Mashups are identified, characterized, and evaluated with focus on their adequacy for B2B collaborations.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246210,Domain-Specific Processing of Policies or: WS-Policy Intersection Revisited.,"We present a new approach for checking the compatibility of policy descriptions. At present, policies are widely used for explicitly expressing non-functional properties, capabilities, constraints and requirements of Web services. Policies are crucial in the negotiation phase of service discovery and selection. Typically, a potential service consumer has its own policy that specifies the conditions the service has to fulfill. Ideally, an automatic negotiation process identifies a mutually agreeable policy for both the Web service consumer and provider. WS-Policy defines policy intersection as a ""first approximation"" for determining the compatibility of policies. However, policy intersection has a major weakness: It is a purely syntactic approach neglecting the semantics of the involved policy assertions. In addition, it is unspecific on how to include domain-specific processing. In this paper we present a new solution that overcomes these deficits by introducing an entailment relation that reflects the semantics of assertions and policies. This paper not only discusses the formal foundations but also introduces the required algorithms such as ""semantic policy differencing"".",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246211,From Workflow Models to Executable Web Service Interfaces.,"Workflow models have been used and refined for years to execute processes within organisations. To deal with collaborative processes (choreographies) these internal workflow models have to be aligned with the external behaviour advertised through Web service interfaces. However, traditional workflow management systems (WfMS) do not offer this functionality. Simply sharing and merging process models is often not possible, because workflow management lacks a widely accepted standard theory for workflow models.Multiple research and standardisation efforts to integrate different workflow theories have been proposed over the years. XPDL is the most widely used standard for process model interchange and supported by over 80 systems.However, XPDL also lacks the possibility to relate a workflow model to its possible choreography interface abstractions.To remedy this situation, we propose to abstract the XPDL model to a higher-level model, perform the integration and the compaction algorithms at that level and then ground it back to the desired choreography models. We develop and use an integrated ontology which is based on the XPDL standard for this purpose. To facilitate the abstraction and grounding, we present a mapping procedure to automatically translate XPDL and BPMN workflow models into this ontology. After translation, these models are annotated with a parameterised role model and other collaborative properties. We present a compaction procedure that automatically maps the annotated models into external choreography interfaces that expose only the relevant information for a particular partner collaboration. Our procedure is agnostic with respect to the target choreography model. We demonstrate our approach using WSMO choreographies which enables us to automatically generate interface models from any WfMSs that supports XPDL export.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246212,Web Service Ranking Using Semantic Profile Information.,"The promise of dynamic binding and the ability to dynamically and seamlessly move between service providers can only be realized through the path of semantic expressibility. Once we describe the semantics of a service in itâ€™s advertisement, a semantic matchmaker can match a query with the set of advertisements that satisfy the query conditions. The state of the art today uses the IOPE (Inputs Outputs Preconditions and Effects) form of advertisements with languages such as OWL-S being used to represent the semantics. Inputs and outputs usually refer to concepts in an ontology. Many semantic matchmakers exist today and they focus on matching the IOPE form of the advertisement to the query. This may result in many matches and they return a set of matched advertisements without rank ordering them. We believe itâ€™s important to rank the returned set of services in order to choose the best service. In this paper we present such a ranking algorithm that uses the IOPE information present in the each of the services relative to the query. Our algorithm can complement other approaches that use the history of issued queries and data mining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of the ranking algorithm against a benchmark ranking that is done manually and shown that our ranking scheme is close to the best ranking scheme possible.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246213,An Abstract GFSM Model for Optimal and Incremental Conformance Testing of Web Services.,"Web service conformance testing checks the correctness of a black box service implementation, and it is the basis of other testings. An efficient formal method for conformance testing is the Chinese Postman traversal algorithm [2] that can find minimum-cost test sequences.However, the applicability of this algorithm is in question if data dependences are present in the protocol specification. Also, it suffers from the limited observability problem which is not uncommon in web services. Despite its optimality, the traversal algorithm does not take advantages of the special patterns in web service interfaces observed by developers. To address these issues, we propose an abstract GFSM (Guarded Finite-State Machine) model that unifies and augments the commonly used Moore and Mealy machines with dataflows. Using this abstract model, we formalize the conditions under which the tours with complete data and control coverage are guaranteed, and address the limited observability problem using the equivalence of Moore and Mealy machines. Furthermore, we propose a Recursive Descent traversal algorithm that explores the inverse operation pattern of web services to facilitate incremental development of web services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246214,A Flexible Approach for Automatic Process Decentralization Using Dependency Tables.,"Web service paradigm and related technologies have provided favorable means for the realization of collaborative business processes. From both conceptual and implementation points of view, the business processes are based on a centralized management approach. Nevertheless, it is very well known that the enterprise-wide process management where processes may span multiple organizational units requires particular considerations on scalability, heterogeneity, availability and privacy issues, that in turn, require particular consideration on decentralization. In this paper, our aim is to reconcile the decentralization of processes as a step towards the enterprise-wide solutions. We propose a methodology for transforming a centralized process specification into a form that is amenable to a distributed execution and to incorporate the necessary synchronization between different processing entities. The proposed technique has the advantage of being flexible that it computes the abstract constructs and provides a generalized approach to the decentralization of processes.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246215,A Web Service Architecture for Decentralised Identity- and Attribute-Based Access Control.,"The loosely coupled nature of Service-oriented Architectures raises the question how information for access control can be managed in an efficient way. Several specifications for Web Services exist to describe security requirements and to facilitate a provision of identity information. However, the integration of different standards regarding the expression of identity information in policies, claims and assertions comes along with an increased complexity. In order to identify and address the problems occurring with the combined use of standards as XACML, SAML and WS-Trust, we designed and implemented an architecture for identity- and attribute-based access control in decentralized environments. Our implementation provides an automated generation of access control policies in a format called XACML, a way to communicate required user attributes as claims across different domains based on the standards WS-Trust and WS-Policy, and a consistent mapping of retrieved attribute assertions to the XACML attributes in the access control policy.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246216,Towards Scalability of Quality Driven Semantic Web Service Composition.,"Optimizating semantic web service compositions is known to be NP-hard, so most approaches restrict the number of services and offer poor scalability. We address the scalability issue by selecting compositions which satisfy a set of constraints rather than attempting to produce an optimal composition. Firstly, we define constraints within an innovative and extensible quality model designed to balance semantic fit (or functional quality) with quality of service (QoS) metrics. The semantic fit criterion evaluates the quality of semantic links between the semantic description of Web services parameters, whilst QoS focuses on non-functional criteria of services. Coupling these criteria allows us to further constrain and select valid compositions. To allow the use of this model in the context of millions of services as foreseen by the strategic EC-funded project SOA4All, we i) formulate the selection problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and ii) test the use of a stochastic search method. Finally we compare the latter with state-of-the-art approaches.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246217,A Service-Oriented System for Optimizing Residential Energy Use.,"Significant consumption and cost savings can be made by better managing energy usage within small commercial properties and individual dwellings. By combining Web services and off-the-shelf home automation equipment, it is now possible to build a cost-effective infrastructure to support the delivery of energy management services to small consumers. In this paper we treat residential energy management as a resource management problem in a distributed computing system. Energy consumers are able to delegate the energy management of smart-meter connected appliances to these energy service providers and specify their energy consumption preference through access policies. We give an optimal scenario in terms of energy cost and efficiency in this service model. We also design an algorithm that makes use of aggregated user information to achieve near optimal energy use among residential electricity users.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246218,Timed Model Checking Based Approach for Web Services Analysis.,"Web services are the main pillar of the Service Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm which enables the application integration within and across business organizations. One of the important features of the Web services is the choreography aspect which allows to capture collaborative processes involving multiple services. In this context, one of the important investigations is the choreography compatibility analysis. We mean by the choreography compatibility the capability of a set of Web services of actually interacting by exchanging messages in a proper manner. Whether a set of services are compatible depends not only on their sequences of messages but also on quantitative properties such as timed properties. In this paper, we investigate a model checking based approach that deals with checking the compatibility of a choreography in which the Web services support asynchronous timed communications. Particularly, in this paper we are using the model checker UPPAAL. We propose a set of required abstractions that allow to use the model checker UPPAAL to deal with timed asynchronous communicating services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246219,DIALOG: Distributed Auditing Logs.,"Service-oriented systems facilitate business workflows to span multiple organizations (e.g. by means of Web services). As a side effect, data may be more easily transferred over organizational boundaries. Thus, privacy issues arise. At the same time, there are personal, business and legal requirements for protecting privacy and IPR and allowing customers to request information about how and by whom their data was handled. Managing these requirements constitutes an unsolved technical and organizational problem. We propose to solve the information request problem by attaching meta-knowledge about how data was handled to the data itself. We present our solution, in form of an architecture, a formalization and an implemented prototype for logging and collecting logs in service-oriented and cross organizational systems.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246220,A Conceptual Modeling Approach to Business Service Mashup Development.,"Professional mashups that include complex choreographies, data mediation, and result publishing within Web pages are still affected by implementation and design practices that rely either on very simple models or on low-level scripting and programming skills of developers, thus hampering the use of mashups in business context as rapid solution to immediate problems. Indeed, industrialization of their development is still a hard objective to achieve.We propose adesign methodology based on visual models to improve the quality and the productivity of service mashups and presentation of the results, thus increasing their acceptance as professional applications in the business scenario. Existing software engineering methods are combined together in an innovative mix, comprising standard business process modeling languages (namely, BPMN) to describe a high-level view of the mashup orchestration and on WebML (Web Modeling Language) to specify the detailed Web application model, including Web service interactions, hypertext navigation, event management, and rich user interfaces.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246221,Gradual Removal of QoS Constraint Violations by Employing Recursive Bargaining Strategy for Optimizing Service Composition Execution Path.,"A critical issue in service composition area is how to achieve an optimized overall end-to-end quality of service(QoS) requirements by effectively coordinating QoS constraints for individual service. However, this issue has not yet been well addressed.In this paper, we propose a novel method by employing a recursive bargaining Strategy to gradually remove QoS constraint violations for Optimizing service composition execution Path. Our method mainly exploits the hidden market competitive relationships which widely exist in real business world for developing a novel bargaining strategy. Based on this strategy, concessions can be made by service providers to offer better QoS values. By recursively using bargaining strategy, an initial execution path built by a local optimization policy for service composition, can be continually updated to be close to the optimal one by reselecting better service providers for meeting overall end-to-end QoS requirements. An experiment and evaluation have been made to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246222,Vulnerable Cloud: SOAP Message Security Validation Revisited.,"The service-oriented architecture paradigm is influencing modern software systems remarkably and Web Services are a common technology to implement such systems. However, the numerous Web Service standard specifications and especially their ambiguity result in a high complexity which opens the door for security-critical mistakes.This paper aims on raising awareness of this issue while discussing a vulnerability in Amazonâ€™s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) services to XML wrapping attacks, which has since been resolved as a result of our findings and disclosure. More importantly, this paper discusses the verification steps required to effectively validate an incoming SOAP request. It reviews the available work in the light of the discovered Amazon EC2 vulnerability and provides a practical guideline for achieving a robust and effective SOAP message security validation mechanism.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246223,A Plug-in Architecture for Self-Adaptive Web Service Compositions.,"Several approaches have been proposed to introduce self-management capabilities for web service compositions.However, most of these works are limited as they are not extensible, i.e., new self-adaptation features cannot be supported, and even if that is possible then still this cannot be done dynamically while the composite services are running.In addition, many of these works are not based on the service composition standard WS-BPEL. In this paper, we propose a plug-in architecture for self-adaptive web service composition, in which self-adaptation features are well-modularized in aspect based plug-ins. Our approach supports application-specific adaptation scenarios, is easily extensible, and allows self-adaptation logic to be hot-deployed on running process instances. We have implemented this architecture and several plug-ins using the dynamic aspect-oriented workflow language AO4BPEL.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246224,Application of Management Frameworks to Manage Workflow-Based Systems: A Case Study on a Large Scale E-science Project.,"Management architectures are well discussed in the literature, but their application in real life settings has not been as well covered. Automatic management of a system involves many more complexities than closing the control-loop by reacting to sensor data and executing corrective actions. In this paper, we discuss those complexities and propose solutions to those problems on top of Hasthi management framework, where Hasthi is a robust, scalable, and distributed management framework that enables users to manage a system by enforcing management logic authored by users themselves. Furthermore, we present in detail a real life case study, which uses Hasthi to manage a large, SOA based, E-Science Cyberinfrastructure.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246225,Intelligent Matching for Public Internet Web Services Towards Semi-Automatic Internet Services Mashup.,"In this paper, we propose an Internet public Web service matching approach that paves the way for (semi-)automatic service mashup. We will first provide the overview of the solution, which requires a detailed review of two fundamental models â€“ schema/graph matching and semantic space. Based on the conceptual model and the literature study, the complete service matching approach is then provided with four essential steps â€“ semantic space, parameter tree, similarity measures, and WSDL operation matching. The system demonstration that proves the concept proposed in this approach is finally presented. The solution has the potential to facilitate the Internet services mashup.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246226,Static vs. Dynamic Validation of BSP Conformance.,"WS-I's Basic Security Profile (BSP) defines best practice guidelines for secure web services communications, enabling interoperability between vendors. However it is difficult for developers to know if their SOA solutions are in fact compliant to these guidelines. In this paper, we discuss methods to assess compliance against BSP. We have implemented runtime validation of SOAP messages to check for compliance against BSP, a method implied by the BSP definition itself. Additionally, we have implemented a novel approach to statically validate WS Security policies against BSP using Schematron. From our experiments dynamic validation for BSP compliance offers greater coverage but results in a significant overhead, while static validation is limited in its scope but extremely valuable since under reasonable assumptions it provides assurances about compliance prior to deployment. We conclude with a summation of our results and lessons for SOA practitioners.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246227,A Mobility-Based Clustering and Discovery of Web Services in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks.,"Web services allow devices running on different platforms to communicate with one another using standardized definitions and access ways. Due to recent developments in mobile networks and devices, many researches are on going to apply Web services to mobile network environments. In this paper, we propose an efficient method that discovers services based on a proposed mobility-based clustering in mobile ad-hoc networks. In order to maintain stable clusters and select a proper service discovery architecture, the proposed method uses the mobility of nodes including direction. Experimental results under different mobility models show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional clustering and service discovery method.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246228,Privacy Time-Related Analysis in Business Protocols.,"To automate the analysis of service descriptions, [6] proposeda simple and expressive business protocolmodel (the specification of possible message exchange sequences) based on state machines, supporting rich timing constraints. Furthermore, developers of client applications need to be aware not only of functional aspects but also of non-functional aspects including privacy. In fact, the major concerns of a client are the disclosure of its personnel data conveyed during the message exchange. The aim of the paper is to studythe ability of business protocol to handle the privacy and its time-related properties.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246229,A Framework for Optimal Decentralized Service-Choreography.,We address the problem of optimizing mediator-based service composition where the services and the desired composition (goal) functionality are represented as i/o automata with loops. The objective of optimization is to minimize the costs of communications and computations necessary to realize the goal from the existing services. We develop an algorithm to compute the minimum cost of an automaton representing the choreographed behavior of services realizing the goal. This forms the central theme of our technique for developing automatically a strategy of decentralized mediation that will result in the optimized composition of services.,2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246230,Personalized Web Service Ranking via User Group Combining Association Rule.,"Web service plays an important role in implementing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for achieving dynamic business process. With the increased number of web services advertised in public repository, it is becoming vital to provide an efficient web service discovery and selection mechanism with respect to a userâ€™s requirement. Considerable efforts have been made to solve this problem among which semantic based web service discovery has been attained much importance by researchers in academic and industry community. However, there is a challenge in the semantic based web service discovery process, that is, among the retrieved set of semantically equivalent web service candidates, how to discern which one is the best? In this paper, inspired by collaborative filtering idea, a web service ranking framework is proposed in which a set of users with similar interest will be firstly identified. Afterwards, association rules will be found out by analyzing all web service composition transactions related to that set of users. By combining user group and association rule mined from that group, a personalized web service ranking mechanism is achieved and the experiment shows the promising result.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246231,Collaborative Scientific Workflows.,"In recent years, a number of scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs) have been developed to help domain scientists synergistically integrate distributed computations, datasets, and analysis tools to enable and accelerate scientific discoveries. As more scientific research projects become collaborative in nature, there is a compelling need of dedicated services to support collaborative scientific workflows on the Internet. This paper reviews the state of the art of the field of scientific workflows towards the support of collaborative scientific workflows, identifies critical research challenges, and presents our ongoing research work aiming to study how to create services supporting collaborative scientific workflows.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246232,Control Flow Requirements for Automated Service Composition.,"Automated composition of services is a key functionality for the adoption of the service-oriented development paradigm. Solving this problem in practice requires the ability to consider asynchronous stateful services and to express complex composition requirements which may span different phases of the life-cycle of component services. In this paper we present a novel automated service composition approach which addresses these challenges by associating so-called 'objects' to services, and by introducing a simple yet powerful notation to express composition requirements on them. We recast this view of the problem as a specific form of planning; our experiments on a prototype implementation witness the ability of our approach to deal with realistic scenarios and requirements that cannot be tackled by other current approaches.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246233,An Approach to Incentive-Based Reputation for Communities of Web Services.,"Community of web services (CWS) is a society composed by a number of functionally identical web services. The communities always aim to increase their reputation level in order to obtain more requests. In this paper, we propose an effective mechanism dealing with reputation assessment for communities of web services. The proposed mechanism is based on after-service feedbacks provided by the users to a run-time logging system. The proposed method defines the evaluation metrics involved in reputation assessment of a community, and supervises the logging system in order to verify the validity and soundness of the feedbacks provided by the users. In this paper, the proposed framework is described, a theoretical analysis of its assessment and its implementation along with empirical result discussions are provided. We also show how our model is efficient, particularly in very dynamic environments.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246234,BlueInfo: Open Architecture for Deploying Web Services in WPAN Hotspots.,"We introduce BlueInfo, an open architecture for deploying web services in WPAN hotspots for cost-free context-aware mobile access over Bluetooth. A BlueInfo hotspot either pushes subscribed services at desired intervals to registered devices (BlueInfo Push) or alternatively the user invokes a particular service by sending a simple keyword query to the hotspot (BlueInfo Pull). The BlueInfo hotspot requests the service from the origin server in the Internet and relays the response to the mobile device, possibly after adaptation for mobile viewing. The usability of BlueInfo Pull in comparison to a mobile phone browser is demonstrated with an empirical user evaluation conducted in a laboratory setting.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246235,Reducing User Perceived Latency with a Middleware for Mobile SOA Access.,"Network latency is one of the most critical factors for the usability of mobile SOA applications. This paper introduces prefetching and caching enhancements for an existing SOA framework for mobile applications to reduce the user perceived latency. Latency reduction is achieved by proactively sending data to the mobile device that could most likely be requested at a later time. This additional data is piggybacked onto responses to actual requests and injected into a client side cache, so that it can be used without an additional connection. The prefetching is done automatically using a sequence prediction algorithm. The benefit of prefetching and caching enhancements were evaluated for different network settings and a reduction of user perceived latency of up to 31% was found in a typical scenario. In contrast to other prefetching solutions, our piggybacking approach also allows to significantly increase battery lifetime of the mobile device.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246236,Integrating Abductive Logic Programming and Description Logics in a Dynamic Contracting Architecture.,"In Semantic Web technologies, searching for a service means toidentify components that can potentially satisfy the user needs interms of outputs and effects (discovery), and that, when invoked bythe customer, can fruitfully interact with her (contracting).Inthis paper, we present an application framework that encompassesboth the discovery and the contracting steps, in a unified searchprocess.In particular, we accommodate service discovery byontology-based reasoning, and contracting by automated reasoningabout policies published in a formal language. To this purpose, weconsider a formal approach grounded on Computational Logic, andAbductive Logic Programming in particular. We propose a framework,called SCIFF Reasoning Engine, able to establish, by ontologicaland abductive reasoning, if a semantic web service and a requestercan fruitfully inter-operate, taking as input the behavioralinterfaces of both the participants, and producing as output a sortof a contract.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246237,Equivalence of Web Services in Process-Aware Service Compositions.,"Deciding on web service equivalence in process-aware service compositions is a crucial challenge throughout thecomposition life cycle. Restricting such decisions to (activity) label equivalence constitutes a simplification for many practical applications: if two web services have equivalent labels, does this necessarily mean they are equivalent as well? In many scenarios other factors play an important role. Examples include context information (e.g., input and output messages) and information on the position of web services within compositions. In this paper, we introduce the composition life cycle and discuss specific requirements for web service equivalence along its different phases. We define adequate equivalence notions for design, execution, analysis, and evolution of service compositions. Main focus is put on attribute and position equivalence. Altogether this paper is a first step towards a new understanding and treatment of equivalence notions in service compositions.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246238,Efficient Discovery of Collision-Free Service Combinations.,"Majority of service discovery research considers only primitive services as a suitable match for a given query while service combinations are not allowed. However, many realistic queries cannot be matched by individual services and only a combination of several services can satisfy such queries. Allowing service combinations or proper compositions of primitive services as a valid match introduces problems such as unwanted side-effects (i.e., producing an effect that is not requested), effect duplicities (i.e., producing some effect more than once) and contradictory effects (i.e., producing both an effect and its negation). Also the ranking of matched services has to be reconsidered for service combinations. In this paper, we address all the mentioned issues and present a matchmaking algorithm for retrieval of the best top collision-free service combinations satisfying a given query.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246239,Enforcement from the Inside: Improving Quality of Business in Process Management.,In this paper we introduce a new modeling tool for constraint handling in the area of workflow technology. The constraint handlers can be used to improve the quality of business processes but without changing already existing business logic. Todays workflow languages provide no possibility to model constraints and the actions in case the constraints get violated explicitly. Fault and event handling mechanisms to react to events not expected in normal executions are only provided by the BPEL language. Using BPEL as workflow language we integrate the constraint handling extension without changing any existing semantics in a smart way. In our approach we use this fault and event handling mechanisms to extend the BPEL language with a constraint handling mechanism. By integrating this constraint handling tool into the BPEL language we provide an approach for quality driven process modeling with the BPEL language.,2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246240,Discovery and On-demand Provisioning of Real-World Web Services.,"The increasing usage of smart embedded devices is blurring the line between the virtual and real worlds. This creates new opportunities for applications to better integrate the real-world, providing services that are more diverse, highly dynamic and efficient. Service Oriented Architecture is on the verge of extending its applicability from the standard, corporate IT domainto the real-world devices. In such infrastructures, composed of a large number of resource-limited devices, the discovery of services and on demand provisioning of missing functionality is a challenge. This work proposes a process, its architecture and an implementation that enables developers and process designers to dynamically discover, use, and create running instances of real-world services in composite applications.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246241,Analysis of Signature Wrapping Attacks and Countermeasures.,"In recent research it turned out that Boolean verification of digital signatures in the context of WS-Security is likely to fail: If parts of a SOAP message are signed and the signature verification applied to the whole document returns true, then nevertheless the document may have been significantly altered.In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis on the possible scenarios that enable these signature wrapping attacks. Derived from this analysis, we propose a new solution that uses a subset of XPath instead of ID attributes to point to the signed subtree, and show that this solution is both efficient and secure.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246242,A Unified Test Framework for Continuous Integration Testing of SOA Solutions.,"The quality of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) solutions is becoming more and more important along with the increasing adoption of SOA. Continuous Integration Testing (CIT) is an effective technology to discover bugs as early as possible. However, the diversity of programming models used in an SOA solution and the distribution nature of an SOA solution pose new challenges for CIT. Existing testing frameworks more focus on the integration testing of applications developed by a single programming model. In this paper, a unified test framework is proposed to overcome these limitations and enable the CIT of SOA solutions across the whole development lifecycle.This framework is designed following the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The information of an executable test case is separated into two layers: the behavior layer and the configuration layer. The behavior layer represents the test logic of a test case and is platform independent. The configuration layer contains the platform specific information and is configurable for different programming models. An extensible and pluggable test execution engine is specially designed to execute the integration test cases. A global test case identifier instrumentation approach is used to merge the distributed test case execution traces captured by ITCAM â€“ an IBM integrated management tool. A verification approach supporting Boolean expression and back-end service interaction verification is proposed to verify the test execution result. Initial experiments have shown the effectiveness of this unified test framework.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246243,An Automated Method for Web Service Orchestration Based on Reusable Building Blocks.,"We describe a complete and largely automated method for the development of systems from web services, which comprises the encapsulation of services, as well as their composition, verification and subsequent implementation in a model-driven manner. The paper follows the steps of the method: In a first phase, we import WSDL descriptions automatically as UML~2.x activities and provide them as building blocks, with some optional, manual adaptations. In a second phase, these building blocks can be used to compose an application that orchestrates web services. The building blocks have behavioral contracts that enable automated, incremental verification based on compositional model checking. We demonstrate the approach by a subscription-based service to receive SMS messages.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246244,Efficient Access to Composite M-services.,"Wireless Web services, also called Mobile services or M-services, provide access to Web services through wireless networks. In this paper, we propose novel access methods and multi-channel organization for mobile users to effectively access composite M-services in wireless broadcast networks. We define a few semantics for accessing broadcast based M-services and study their impact on access efficiency.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246245,A Novel Dynamic Priority Scheduling Algorithm of Process Engine in SOA.,EAI and SOA are widely adopted in enterprise information systems with business processes being orchestrated by a process engine. An algorithm which schedules tasks of process instances to maximize overall customer satisfaction is proposed in this paper. This new algorithm maximizes the total value of all process instances by dynamically assigning different priority to each task based on the business value and time-left of the corresponding process instances. The value of each kind of process instance is modeled as a utility function of response time which reflects the inverse proportional relationship between the customer satisfaction and response time. Experiments show that the total value of utility function with the proposed algorithm is promoted a lot than traditional methods.,2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246246,WS-Policy: On Conditional and Custom Assertions.,"Today, Web services play a dominant role in Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and for realizing Service Oriented Architectures (SOA), which define the architectural foundation for various kinds of distributed applications. In many business domains, Web services must exhibit quality attributes such as robustness, security, and maintainability. As a consequence, there is a high demand to develop Web services with Quality of Service (QoS) properties. Several specifications of the WS-* family, e.g. WS-Security and WS-Reliable Messaging, aim at simplifying the development and deployment of QoS-aware Web services. Although these approaches cover some typical application scenarios, their expressivity and flexibility are limited by the underlying WS-Policy framework. This paper proposes the syntax and semantics of a new WS-Policy operator that enables the introduction of conditional assertions. Secondly, a framework for managing different types of custom assertions is presented. Finally, this paper describes a proof of concept implementation demonstrating the practical feasibility of both extensions.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246247,Risk Management Framework for Service-Oriented Architecture.,"Transition to Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is underway in the military and there have been many excellent examples of cutting-edge SOA and web service implementations. However, the process to build services for SOA frameworks is not well defined and therein poses a security risk. This research develops models, methodologies and specifications to help programmers integrate their work into selected SOA, including the installation of security appropriate to SOA. Research will establish baselines, models and specifications to help define, categorize, normalize, and weight security risks in distributed SOA. To be included are methodology to help manage security risk.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246248,BPEL'n'Aspects: Adapting Service Orchestration Logic.,"The need for flexibility in process-based applications, in particular during their execution, places the demand for enabling adaptability of processes. AOP is considered to be one of the approaches to flexibly switch on and off functionality on per-instance basis in applications during their execution; analogously, this paradigm can be applied in a BPEL environment to enable adaptation of running orchestrations. In the presented approach we strive towards reuse of as much concepts and technology already available in a Web service (WS) environment as possible. We combine standard BPEL, the publish/subscribe paradigm and WS-Policy so that WS operations play the role of aspects with respect to BPEL processes. We present the syntax for such aspects as an extension of the WS-Policy framework. We introduce the architecture of the supporting infrastructure and a prototypical implementation. The approach draws on the combined benefits of service orientation and the AOP paradigm to improve the state-of-the-art techniques for flexibility of service orchestrations in a non-intrusive manner.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246249,Markov-HTN Planning Approach to Enhance Flexibility of Automatic Web Service Composition.,"Automatic Web services composition can be achieved by using AI planning techniques. HTN planning has been adopted to handle the OWL-S Web service composition problem. However, existing composition methods based on HTN planning have not considered the choice of decompositions available to a problem which can lead to a variety of valid solutions.In this paper, we propose a model of combining a Markov decision process model and HTN planning to address Web services composition. In the model, HTN planning is enhanced to decompose a task in multiple ways and hence be able to find more than one plan,taking both functional and non-functional properties into account. Furthermore, an evaluation method to choose the optimal plan and some experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach works effectively.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246250,Interoperability Changes in an Adaptive Service Orchestration.,"Business Processes realized by services rely on the functionality of these services. Maintaining the interoperability when services evolve independently is therefore an important and challenging problem. If adaptation is to happen automatically, then determining and categorizing changes and their solutions is crucial. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) We provide an overview of previously defined mismatches and provide a common representation based on model management operators. (2)We present a categorization of changes with the categories non-effective, solvable and problematic and validate our categorization. (3) We provide solutions for changes that fall under the solvable category in terms of adaptation operators and describe the process of (self-)adaptation.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246251,LiveMig: An Approach to Live Instance Migration in Composite Service Evolution.,"Composite service evolution is one of the most important challenges to deal with in the field of service composition. In particular, this paper presents, LiveMig, an approach to live migration of composite service instance, which is a critical step for online composite service evolution. In LiveMig, a set of change operations preserving soundness is first defined. Second, a live instance state migration algorithm is proposed to determine if the state migration is allowed or not, and to compute the exact state after the migration. Finally, the correctness of LiveMig is theoretically proved, and an extensive set of simulations are performed to show its feasibility and effectiveness.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246252,What are the Problem Makers: Ranking Activities According to their Relevance for Process Changes.,"Recently, a new generation of adaptive process management technology has emerged, which enables dynamic changes of composite services and process models respectively. This, in turn, results in a large number of process variants derived from the same process model, but differing in structure due to the applied changes. Since such process variants are expensive to maintain, the process model should be evolved accordingly. In this context, we need to know which activities have been more often involved in process adaptations than others, such that we can focus on them when reconfiguring the process model. This paper provides two approaches for ranking activities according to their involvement in process adaptations. The first one allows to precisely rank the activities, but is expensive to perform since the algorithm is at NP level. We therefore provide as alternative an approximation ranking algorithm which computes in polynomial time. The performance of the approximation algorithm is evaluated and compared through a simulation of 3600 process models. Statistical significance tests indicate that the performance of the approximation ranking algorithm does not depend on the size of process models, i.e., our algorithm can scale up.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246253,Inferring Behavioural Models from Traces of Business Applications.,We present an approach to the inference of automata models of web-based business applications using only execution traces recording the externally observable behavior of such applications. The proposed approach yields behavioral models representing both the control flow of an application and the data variations corresponding to different types of users. We also describe how the obtained models allow the use of verification techniques like model checking in the validation phase using a case study featuring a travel reservation agency.,2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246254,Modeling Cost-Aware Web Services Composition Using PTCCS.,"Process algebra are a set of formal languages that are suitable to describe concurrent and communication systems including web services. Nowadays, although process algebra have been effectively exploited for modeling and verifying functional aspects of web services composition, non-functional aspects have been ignored due to process algebra lack of capability of modeling them. Since execution of web services need to consume resource (and energy, time, fee, etc), we propose an abstract concept, that is, cost, to model this non-functional aspect. We introduce this abstract concept into TCCS(Temporal Calculus of Communicating Systems) that is a classical process algebra and propose a new process algebra called PTCCS(Priced Temporal Calculus of Communicating Systems). We present syntax and semantics of PTCCS, and prove that PTCCS extends TCCS with cost modeling capability. And an algorithm is proposed to construct cost state space that is used to select web services composition with optimal cost. Experiment results show that PTCCS can model both functional aspects and non-functional aspects of web services composition.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246255,An Adaptive Tradeoff Model for Service Performance and Security in Service-Based Systems.,"The message-based communication among services inService Oriented Architecture (SOA) is vulnerable to various security attacks, and has to be well protected by security mechanisms, which may sacrifice service performance due to limited system resources. In this paper, an adaptive tradeoff model for service performance and security in service based systems is presented. This model can be used to adjust security configurations of services to provide sufficient protection and satisfy service performance requirements for SOA-based systems simultaneously. The construction of this model includes the development of a set of metrics to quantitatively measure the performance and security of services, the development of a tradeoff objective function incorporating service performance and security, and the parameter estimation through experiments. An example of service-based secure voice communication system is used to illustrate the construction of this model.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246256,Scientific Workflows as Services in caGrid: A Taverna and gRAVI Approach.,"In scientific collaboration platforms such as caGrid,workflow-as-a-service is a useful concept for various reasons, such as easy reuse of workflows, access to remote resources, security concerns, and improved execution performance. We propose a solution for facilitating workflow-as-a-service based on Taverna as the workflow engine and gRAVI as a service wrapping tool. We provide both a generic service to execute all Taverna workflows, and an easy-to-use tool (gRAVI-t) for users to wrap their workflows as workflow-specific services, without developing service code. The signature of the specific service is identical to the corresponding workflow's input/output definition and is therefore more self-explained to workflow users. These two categories of services are useful in different scenarios, respectively. We use a tumor analysis workflow as an example to demonstrate how the workflow-as-a-service approach benefits the execution performance. Finally a conclusion is drawn and future research opportunities are discussed.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246257,WS-OBJECTS: Extending Service-Oriented Architecture with Hierarchical Composition of Client-Side Asynchronous Event-Processing Logic.,"There is a growing need for a new type of WS-*/SOA standards that could facilitate hierarchical, object-oriented composition of client-side executable code. This is especially true for the sorts of client-side logic embedded in AJAX and rich Internet applications, virtual worlds and MMORPGs; code that deals with issuing requests to servers, processing their responses, rendering UI, interacting with users, and processing asynchronous events from other client nodes. The paper offers an analysis of client-side composition patterns, a brief explanation why they lack adequate support from the existing web technologies, and design guidelines for client-side component integration environments to follow. The proposed guidelines have been successfully implemented in a prototype system. Our analysis is thus strongly rooted in reality; it is based on real experiences with concrete application scenarios. The paper concludes by highlighting the key architectural aspects of our implementation with respect to the principles listed earlier.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246258,Generic Web Services Extensible Functionality with Stable Interface.,"Extending the functionality of Web services without invalidating the code of existing clients has been a challenging task. This paper proposes a new interface design technique called ""Generic Web Services"" that preserves a service's backwards compatibility while enriching its functionality. This is accomplished by applying interface relaxation technique - shifting the semantics of a service's API from design time to runtime by using identity parameters. The paper gives an example illustrating the idea on a Web service from SAP Enterprise Services Workplace.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246259,A Dependency Impact Analysis Model for Web Services Evolution.,"As many software systems have been turned as Web services, the evolutionary changes of Web services are becoming an important issue. To understand the way in which the change affects the services, we must ascertain parts of the system that will be effected by the change and examine them for additional impacts. In this paper, we propose an impact analysis model based on service dependency. In particular, the service dependency graph model, service dependency and the relation matrix are examined. Based on the shift and calculation of the matrix, the dependency and impact of the service evolution can be analyzed and its quantity can be ascertained. Furthermore, we also represent an approach for service change annotation and for service evolution process. Overall, these works provide a foundation for the automatic management, control, and evaluation of service evolution.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246260,Discovery of Semantic Web Service Flow Based on Computation.,"Key-word based researches of service discovery focus on direct match of userâ€™s requirements and often neglect relations between services. While techniques based on conventional semantic offer many kinds of relations, considerable time is spent on reasoning. In this paper, we utilizes E-FCM (Element Fuzzy Cognitive Map) to describe services for the reason that E-FCM can keep the semantic information as much as possible and E-FCMs can be automatically created for web services. Furthermore, instead of reasoning, the semantic relations among E-FCM are built based on computation, therefore semantic relations among services can be found out quickly. We focus on the associated semantic relations among services because complex applications always comprise of services with associated functions. The associated link network (ALN) is constructed upon associated relations to generate associated web service flows, which can be used to create complex applications, thus to facilitate discovery efficiency and improve utilization of services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246261,Reiki: Serviceability Architecture and Approach for Reduction and Management of Product Service Incidents.,"There is a significant number of IT failures per year because parts fail, products are used in ways they were not designed for, and humans make errors in using products. These failures result in incidents that product vendors service as a part of the warranty or contracts. Incidents incur significant costs for servicing them, including call centers, parts, and field engineers. Some of the major problems include lack of coherent incident information, leading to inaccurate service diagnosis and inability to forecast failures. At the same time, technology has evolved. Hardware is generally more reliable, failures are moving from hardware to firmware, software, and applications. The scale effect limits human operator engagement, prevents centralized approaches, and expands automation. Traditional ways of handling incidents are not appropriate any more.In this paper we present a set of tools and approaches that enable unified serviceability with self-healing, automated learning, and an analysis engine. Unified serviceability with self-healing results in clean incident data and it reduces criticality of incidents into deferred maintenance. Automated learning produces empirically proven actionable knowledge enabling cost reduction of automated incident resolution. Using clean data and actionable knowledge, the analysis engine helps predict failures and determine trends, resulting in preventive maintenance. Collectively, preventive and deferred maintenance and automated incident service significantly reduce the costs. This way we have aligned incidents cost with the technology trends.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246262,A Petri Net Siphon Based Solution to Protocol-Level Service Composition Mismatches.,"Protocol-level mismatch is one of the most important problems in service composition. The commonly used reachability exploration method focuses on verifying deadlock-freeness. When this property is violated, the states and traces in the reachability graph only give clues to re-design the composition. The process must then repeat itself until no deadlock is found. In this paper, multiple web service interaction is modeled with a Petri net called Composition net (C-net). The protocol-level mismatch problem is transformed into the deadlock structure problem of a C-net. If mismatches are found, a solution based on Petri net siphons is proposed. The proposed method is shown to achieve higher efficiency for resolving protocol-level mismatching issues than traditional ones do.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246263,Scalable Optimized Composition of Web Services with Complexity Analysis.,"This paper addresses a fundamental issue of web service composition.We present a simple but powerful conceptual model that leads to a scalable approach to automatically constructing a composite web service to meet its requirements by using as few services as possible.Our approach is based on a state space model that has a monotone property to allow efficient search along with efficient algorithms for pruning and simple parallelization. We provide both empirical and theoretical analyses of the proposed approach and show that it has time complexity of O(n^2), for a repository with n services.However, the approach takes linear time for sequential compositions when service applicability is performed by service discovery and thus, it is shown to give asymptotically optimal performance. Although optimality in the number of services deployed is not guaranteed, our experiments on public benchmark data sets show correct optimized solutions 100% of the time, with a reduction in the average running time, compared to a well-performed planning-based system, of better than 35% over 207 composition problems.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246264,Adaptive Prefetching Scheme Using Web Log Mining in Cluster-Based Web Systems.,"The main memory management has been a critical issue to provide high performance in web cluster systems.To overcome the speed gap between processors and disks,many prefetch schemes have been proposed as memory management in web cluster systems. However, inefficient prefetch schemes can degrade the performance of the web cluster system. Dynamic access patterns due to the web cache mechanism in proxy servers increase mispredictions to waste the I/O bandwidth and available memory. Too aggressive prefetch schemes incur the shortage of available memory and performance degradation. Furthermore, modern web frameworks including persistent HTTP make the problem more challenging by reducing the available memory space with multiple connections from a client and web processes management in a prefork mode. Therefore, we attempt to design an adaptive web prefetch scheme by predicting memory status more accurately and dynamically.First, we design Double Prediction-by-Partial-MatchScheme (DPS) that can be adapted to the modern web framework. Second, we propose Adaptive Rate Controller(ARC) to determine the prefetch rate depending on the memory status dynamically. Finally, we suggest Memory Aware Request Distribution (MARD) that distributes requests based on the available web processes and memory.For evaluating the prefetch gain in a server node, we implement an Apache module in Linux. In addition, we build a simulator for verifying our scheme with cluster environments. Simulation results show 10% performance improvement on average in various workloads.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246265,Aspect-Oriented Quality of Service for Web Services: A Model-Driven Approach.,"Implementing and maintaining non-functional properties related to the monitoring of Quality of Service (QoS) can be expensive and complex tasks; with this paper, we present a model-based approach to the implementation of QoS monitors. Our approach uses platform-independent models in order to describe the system and its related QoS constraints. Then, we conduct Model-Driven Development (MDD) transformations for the implementation of both the system and its QoS constraints. Following the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm, QoS constraints are implemented as aspects, which are weaved into the system implementation. Finally, we present a case study in order to support the evaluation of our approach.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246266,Scalable and Reliable Location Services through Decentralized Replication.,"One of the critical challenges for service oriented computing systems is the capability to guarantee scalable and reliable service provision. This paper presents Reliable GeoGrid, a decentralized service computing architecture based on geographical location aware overlay network for supporting reliable and scalable mobile information delivery services. The reliable GeoGrid approach offers two distinct features. First, we develop a distributed replication scheme, aiming at providing scalable and reliable processing of location service requests in decentralized pervasive computing environments. Our replica management operates on a network of heterogeneous nodes and utilizes a shortcut-based optimization to increase the resilience of the system against node failures and network failures. Second, we devise a dynamic load balancing technique that exploits the service processing capabilities of replicas to scale the system in anticipation of unexpected workload changes and node failures by taking into account of node heterogeneity, network proximity, and changing workload at each node. Our experimental evaluation shows that the reliable GeoGrid architecture is highly scalable under changing service workloads with moving hotspots and highly reliable in the presence of both individual node failures and massive node failures.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246267,RDF Data-Centric Storage.,"The vision of the Semantic Web has brought about new challenges at the intersection of web research and data management. One fundamental research issue at this intersection is the storage of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data: the model at the core of the Semantic Web. We present a data-centric approach for storage of RDF in relational databases. The intuition behind our approach is that each RDF dataset requires a tailored table schema that achieves efficient query processing by (1) reducing the need for joins in the query plan and (2) keeping null storage below a given threshold. Using a basic structure derived from the RDF data, we propose a two-phase algorithm involving clustering and partitioning. The clustering phase aims to reduce the need for joins in a query. The partitioning phase aims to optimize storage of extra (i.e., null) data in the underlying relational database. Our approach does not assume a particular query workload, relevant for RDF knowledge bases with a large number of ad-hoc queries. Extensive experimental evidence using three publicly available real-world RDF data sets (i.e., DBLP, DBPedia, and Uniprot) shows that our schema creation technique provides superior query processing performance compared to state-of-the art storage approaches. Further, our approach is easily implemented, and complements existing RDF-specific databases.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

How to define the mutant operators, generate mutants and test cases automatically according to the requirement model are discussed in detail by the author.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

1246270,Reputation Propagation in Composite Services.,"This paper investigates the problem of reputation management in composite services. Our focus is on developing a method of distribution of reputation received by a composite service to its component services. The proposed method enables the composite service to provide a fair distribution of reputation values so that a component service is neither penalized nor awarded for the bad and good performances respectively, of other component services. Experiment results show that the proposed technique propagates the ""fair share"" of reputation from the composite service to its component services.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246271,Infoset for Service Abstraction and Lightweight Message Processing.,"Web services technologies are undergoing some significant changes at several levels, ranging from architectural styles (REST vs.. SOAP) to message formats.To cope with these changes, there is a need to design services in an abstract fashion that is less sensitive to these changes so that our technological and economic investments are protected. To address this issue, this paper proposes an abstract modeling framework, called Infoset, both as a design and analysis tool and a message processing architecture. The benefit of Infoset is demonstrated first on some dual web services that provide both REST and SOAP access. The Infoset analysis modeling reveals the commonality and differences between dual web services, making it feasible to design abstract web services. Infoset also leads to a rule based message processing architecture that avoids the problems in current static Object/XML SOAP engines. By dynamically computing the context of Infoset rules in message workflows, dependences between integrated web services are reduced and the reusability of services logic is increased. A prototype of this architecture is implemented and the preliminary experimental results indicate that the performance is satisfactory.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246272,A MapReduce-Enabled Scientific Workflow Composition Framework.,"MapReduce has recently gained a lot of attention as a parallel programming model for scalable data-intensive business and scientific analysis. In order to benefit from this powerful programming model in a scientific workflow environment, we propose a MapReduce-enabled scientific workflow composition framework consisting of: i) a dataflow based scientific workflow model that separates the declaration of the workflow interface from the definition of its functional body; ii) a set of dataflow constructs, including Map, Reduce, Loop, and Conditional, and their composition semantics to enable MapReduce-style scientific workflows; iii) an XML-based scientific workflow specification language, called WSL, in which both Map and Reduce are fully composable with other dataflow constructs in both flat and hierarchical manners. Besides leveraging the power of MapReduce to the workflow level, our workflow composition framework is unique in that workflows are the only operands for composition; in this way, our approach elegantly solves the two-world problem of existing composition frameworks, in which composition needs to deal with both the world of tasks and the world of workflows. The proposed framework is implemented and a case study is conducted to validate our techniques.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

1246274,An Efficient Service Discovery Algorithm for Counting Bloom Filter-Based Service Registry.,"The Service registry, the yellow pages of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), plays a central role in SOA-based service systems. The service registry has to be scalable to manage large number of services along with their requirements on storage and discovery. Based on our previous work on feature-based services quantification, we characterize services according to their diverse functional and non-functional requirements, and represent them as string formats which can be stored, probed, and indexed by efficient data structures,such as hash table and Bloom filter. Then, we propose a comprehensive service-storage solution using the counting Bloom filter (CBF). The application of CBF enables us to structure candidate services into separate groups, resulting in an accelerated services discovery process. The contributions of this research work include a new approach to manage large number of services based on quantified service features, and a storage architecture design to support service discovery. Experimental results strongly support these claims.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246275,Distributed Cross-Domain Change Management.,"Distributed systems increasingly span organizational boundaries and, with this, system and service management domains. Web services are the primary means of exposing services to clients, be it in electronic commerce, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or on cloud platforms and are being used and integrated with customer-managed applications as well as in complex mashups. Maturing cross-domain relationships and an increase in loose coupling and ad-hocness makes managing configuration changes, e.g., changes in interfaces or endpoints, increasingly relevant. Traditional service management processes within organizations, in particular change management, relies on a central configuration management database (CMDB) to assess the impact a change has on other components of the system. However, this approach does not work in a cross-domain environment, due to the lack of a central CMDB, centralized management processes, and knowledge by service providers which clients depends on their respective services. This paper proposes the Change 2.0 approach to cross-domain change management based on an inversion of responsibility for impact assessment and the facilitation of cross-domain service process integration. We present the requirements imposed by cross-domain change management, the Change 2.0 architecture, and a brief evaluation of its benefits.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246276,A Dynamic Approach toward QoS-Aware Service Workflow Composition.,"Web service-based workflow management systems have garnered considerable attention for automating and scheduling dependent operations. Such systems often support user preferences, e.g., time of completion, but with the rebirth of distributed computing via the grid/cloud, new challenges are abound: multiple disparate data sources, networks, nodes, and the potential for moving very large datasets. In this paper, we present a framework for integrating QoS support in a service workflow composition system. The relationship between workflow execution time and accuracy is exploited through an automatic workflow composition scheme. The algorithm, equipped with a framework for defining cost models on service completion times and error propagation, composes service workflows which can adapt to user's QoS preferences.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246277,Discovery of Optimized Web Service Configurations Using a Hybrid Semantic and Statistical Approach.,"We present a Semantic Optimized Service Discovery (SemOSD) approach capable of handling Web service search requests on a fine-grained level of detail where we augment semantic service descriptions with statistically built predictor functions. Our approach combines ontologies and mathematical functions built using statistical regression over previous Web service interactions. In the search requests we allow for arbitrary, independent and dependent constraints and user preferences expressed using objective functions. Our approach maps to standard Operational Research global optimization problem where algorithms of Simulated Annealing and Differential Evolution are used. It is capable of finding the optimal combination of service input and output parameters (a configuration) to a user request with rich preferences. Our approach is applied to an international package shipment scenario where real (Web) services are used and mined to create price prediction models. We show that the chosen regression method provides price prediction models of high accuracy and our approach supports expressive and complex search requests.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246278,Modeling and Analysis of Flexible Transaction for Web Services.,"A variety of extended transaction models have been proposed in distributed database community, and the development of such models has drawn more attentions since they are not adequate for long-running Web services. From a formal method perspective, a Flexible transaction model for Web services based on MPi-calculus is proposed in this work. MPi-calculus, without introducing any new operators, creates the dynamic association between the changes of transaction scope and their interactive actions in the original Pi-calculus. According to the flexible transaction dependency, a new weak transactional open bisimulation relationship is presented to characterize the transactional equivalence. All of the results can serve as the theoretical foundation to model flexible and powerful mechanisms for implementing long-running transactions.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

The Web Service allows multiple users to share and manage a Web data record extraction task to increase its utility. A recommendation system, based on the Probabilistic Latency Semantic Indexing algorithm, enables a user to find potentially interesting content or other users who share the same interests with the user. A distributed computing platform improves the scalability of the Web Service in supporting multiple users by employing multiple server computers. A Web Service interface allows users to access the Web Service, and allows programmers to develop their own applications and, thus, extend the functionality of the Web Service.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

As an early paper addressing this problem, this paper discusses the challenges of composing RESTful Web services and proposes a formal model for describing individual Web services and automating the composition. It demonstrates our approach by applying it to a real-world RESTful Web service composition problem. This paper represents our initial efforts towards the problem of automated RESTful Web service composition.We are hoping that it will draw interests from the research community on Web services, and engage more researchers in this challenge.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246284,MACE: A Dynamic Caching Framework for Mashups.,"The recent surge of popularity has established Mashups as an important category of Web 2.0 applications. Mashups are essentially Web services that are often created by end-users. They aggregate and manipulate data from sources around the World Wide Web. Surprisingly, there are very few studies on the scalability and performance of mashups. In this paper, we study caching as a vehicle for enhancing the scalability and the efficiency of mashups. Although caching has long been used to improve the performance of Web services, mashups pose some unique challenges that necessitate a more dynamic approach to caching. Towards this end, we present MACE - a cache specifically designed for mashups. In designing the MACE framework this paper makes three technical contributions. First, we present a model for representing mashups and analyzing their performance. Second, we propose an indexing scheme that enables efficient reuse of cached data for newly created mashups. Finally, this paper also describes a novel caching policy that analyzes the costs and benefits of caching data at various stages of different mashups and selectively stores data that is most effective in improving system scalability. We report experiments studying the performance of the MACE system.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1246285,SPA: A Comprehensive Framework for Hybrid Solution Provisioning.,"With the emerging technologies like cloud computing and internet scale data centers, radically simplified deployment approaches are critical for the success of the even more complicated solutions. Although there have been many traditional solution deployment approaches, each of them mainly focuses on particular software type or product. In this paper, we propose the next generation solution deployment paradigm as hybrid solution deployment, which enables fast solution deployment from bare metal mode to production mode based on todayâ€™s state-of-the-art provisioning tools. Solution Provisioning Automation (SPA) framework is our practice of such deployment paradigm. In SPA, we use solution template to capture the solution components and their dependencies, which exposes only the necessary parameters for users to customize. Provisioning Requests are placed through reservations and scheduled globally for execution. The SPA engine receives provisioning requests from scheduler, interprets the solution template, manages provisioning tasks and performs runtime logging. We also present a real world case to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is generally acknowledged as being a potential solution to expose finely grained pieces of software components on a network that are reusable and composable. Provisioning of business services for different business purposes may require the rapid assembly of their core functionality with different infrastructure capabilities and policies in different contexts. In this paper, the authors propose a SOA based governance model that permits to handle non functional requirements in a dynamic way.",2009,,,,,ICWS,,,
1293084,Dynamic Web Service Selection for Reliable Web Service Composition.,"This paper studies the dynamic web service selection problem in a failure-prone environment, which aims to determine a subset of web services to be invoked at run-time so as to successfully orchestrate a composite web service. We observe that both the composite and constituent web services often constrain the sequences of invoking their operations and therefore propose to use Finite State Machine to model the permitted invocation sequences of web service operations. We assign each state of execution an aggregated reliability to measure the probability that the given state will lead to successful execution in the context where each web service may fail with some probability. We show that the computation of aggregated reliabilities is equivalent to eigenvector computation and adopt the power method to efficiently derive aggregated reliabilities. In orchestrating a composite web service, we propose two strategies to select web services that are likely to successfully complete the execution of a given sequence of operations. A prototype that implements the proposed approach using BPEL for specifying the invocation order of a web service is developed and served as a testbed for comparing our proposed strategies and other baseline web service selection strategies.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/HwangLLC08,104-116,1,IEEE Trans.

1293085,Probabilistic QoS and Soft Contracts for Transaction-Based Web Services Orchestrations.,"Service level agreements (SLAs), or contracts, have an important role in web services. They define the obligations and rights between the provider of a web service and its client, about the function and the Quality of the service (QoS). For composite services like orchestrations, contracts are deduced by a process called QoS contract composition, based on contracts established between the orchestration and the called web services. Contracts are typically stated as hard guarantees (e.g., response time always less than 5 msec). Using hard bounds is not realistic, however, and more statistical approaches are needed. In this paper we propose using soft probabilistic contracts instead, which consist of a probability distribution for the considered QoS parameter&#x2014;in this paper, we focus on timing. We show how to compose such contracts, to yield a global probabilistic contract for the orchestration. Our approach is implemented by the TOrQuE tool. Experiments on TOrQuE show that overly pessimistic contracts can be avoided and significant room for safe overbooking exists. An essential component of SLA management is then the continuous monitoring of the performance of called web services, to check for violations of the SLA. We propose a statistical technique for run-time monitoring of soft contracts.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/RosarioBHJ08,187-200,1,IEEE Trans.

1293086,Bridging Security and Fault Management within Distributed Workflow Management Systems.,"As opposed to centralized workflow management systems, the distributed execution of workflows can not rely on a trusted centralized point of coordination. As a result, basic security features including compliance of the overall sequence of workflow operations with the pre-defined workflow execution plan or traceability become critical issues that are yet to be addressed. Besides, the detection of security inconsistencies during the execution of a workflow usually implies the complete failure of the workflow although it may be possible in some situations to recover from the latter. In this paper, we present security solutions supporting the secure execution of distributed workflows. These mechanisms capitalize on onion encryption techniques and security policy models to assure the integrity of the distributed execution of workflows, to prevent business partners from being involved in a workflow instance forged by a malicious peer and to provide business partners identity traceability for sensitive workflow instances. Moreover, we specify how these security mechanisms can be combined with a transactional coordination framework to recover from faults that may be caught during their execution. The defined solutions can easily be integrated into distributed workflow management systems as our design is strongly coupled with the runtime specification of decentralized workflows.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/MontagutM08,33-48,1,IEEE Trans.

1293087,Effective Web Service Composition in Diverse and Large-Scale Service Networks.,"The main research focus of Web services is to achieve the interoperability between distributed and heterogeneous applications. Therefore, flexible composition of Web services to fulfill the given challenging requirements is one of the most important objectives in this research field. However, until now, service composition has been largely an error-prone and tedious process. Furthermore, as the number of available web services increases, finding the right Web services to satisfy the given goal becomes intractable. In this paper, toward these issues, we propose an AI planning-based framework that enables the automatic composition of Web services, and explore the following issues. First, we formulate the Web-service composition problem in terms of AI planning and network optimization problems to investigate its complexity in detail. Second, we analyze publicly available Web service sets using network analysis techniques. Third, we develop a novel Web-service benchmark tool called WSBen. Fourth, we develop a novel AI planning-based heuristic Web-service composition algorithm named WSPR. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to verify WSPR against state-of-the-art AI planners. It is our hope that both WSPR and WSBen will provide useful insights for researchers to develop Web-service discovery and composition algorithms, and software.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/OhLK08,15-32,1,IEEE Trans.

1293089,Adaptive Secure Access to Remote Services in Mobile Environments.,"Since the inception of service-oriented computing paradigm, we have witnessed a plethora of services deployed across a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from conventional RPC-based services to SOAP-based Web services. Likewise, the proliferation of mobile devices has enabled the remote ""on the move"" access of these services from anywhere at any time. Secure access to these services is challenging especially in a mobile computing environment with heterogeneous modalities. Conventional static access control mechanisms are not able to accommodate complex secure access requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive secure access mechanism to address this problem. Our mechanism consists of two components: an adaptive access control module and an adaptive function invocation module. It not only adapts access control policies to diverse requirements, but also introduces function invocation adaptation during access, which is the missing part of existing access control models. We have successfully applied the proposed adaptive secure access mechanism to a computerassisted surgery application called UbiCAS. Performance evaluation shows that with limited overhead, our technique enforces secure access to the services provided by the UbiCAS system in a flexible way.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/LufeiSC08,49-61,1,IEEE Trans.

1293090,Continually Learning Optimal Allocations of Services to Tasks.,"Open service-oriented systems which autonomously and continually satisfy users' service requests to optimal levels are an appropriate response to the need for increased automation of information systems. Given a service request, an open service-oriented system interprets the functional and nonfunctional requirements laid out in the request and identifies the optimal selection of services&#x2014;that is, identifies services. These services' coordinated execution optimally satisfies the requirements in the request. When selecting services, it is relevant to: (1) revise selections as new services appear and others become unavailable; (2) use multiple criteria, including nonfunctional ones to choose among competing services; (3) base the comparisons of services on observed, instead of advertised performance; and (4) allow for uncertainty in the outcome of service executions. To address issues (1)&#x2013;(4), we propose the Multi-Criteria Randomized Reinforcement Learning (MCRRL) service selection approach. MCRRL learns and revises service selections using a novel multicriteria-driven (including quality of service parameters, deadline, reputation, cost, and preferences) reinforcement learning algorithm, which integrates the exploitation of data about individual services' past performance with optimal, undirected, continual exploration of new selections that involve services whose behavior has not been observed. The experiments indicate the algorithm behaves as expected and outperforms two standard approaches.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/AchbanyJFF08,141-154,1,IEEE Trans.

1293091,Tisa: Toward Trustworthy Services in a Service-Oriented Architecture.,"Verifying whether a service implementation is conforming to its service-level agreements is important to inspire confidence in services in a service-oriented architecture (SoA). Functional agreements can be checked by observing the published interface of the service, but other agreements that are more non-functional in nature, are often verified by deploying a monitor that observes the execution of the service implementation. A problem is that such a monitor must execute in an untrusted environment. Thus, integrity of the results reported by such a monitor crucially depends on its integrity. We contribute an extension of the traditional SoA, based on hardware-based root of trust, that allows clients, brokers and providers to negotiate and validate the integrity of a requirements monitor executing in an untrusted environment. We make two basic claims: first, that it is feasible to realize our approach using existing hardware and software solutions, and second, that integrity verification can be done at a relatively small overhead. To evaluate feasibility, we have realized our approach using current software and hardware solutions. To measure overhead, we have conducted a case study using a collection of web service implementations available with Apache Axis implementation.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/RajanH08,201-213,1,IEEE Trans.

1293094,Coordinated Service Allocation through Flexible Reservation.,"Services are perishable and are simultaneously produced and consumed. A reservation is a traditional and effective means for coordinating service demand and supply. In recent years, computerized reservation systems have been used widely by many service vendors such as airline companies and hotels to satisfy their customer's demands and improve their profits. In this paper, we propose and describe a more flexible reservation method called ""YuuZuu"" reservation that motivates cooperation among customers with different preferences for services. It increases utilization of vendor-provided services. The DREAM reservation system, which is an implementation of ""YuuZuu"" reservation, comprises three functions: (1) reservation allocation, (2) demand analysis, and (3) price optimization. Preliminary experiments show that the DREAM reservation system outperforms a standard reservation system when some customers are insistent upon detailed preferences and others are not, which, we believe, reflects real-world conditions.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/MiyashitaMH08,117-128,1,IEEE Trans.

1293096,A Privacy Preserving Repository for Data Integration across Data Sharing Services.,"Current data sharing and integration among various organizations require a central and trusted authority to first collect data from all data sources and then integrate the collected data. This process tends to complicate the update of data and to compromise data sources' privacy. In this paper, a repository for integrating data from various data sharing services without central authorities is presented. The major differences between our repository and existing central authorities are: 1) Our repository collects data from data sharing services based on users' integration requirements rather than all the data from the data sharing services as existing central authorities. 2) While existing central authorities have full control of the collected data, the capability of our repository is restricted to computing the integration results required by users and cannot get other information about the data or use it for other purposes. 3) The data collected by our repository cannot be used to generate other results except that of the specified data integration request, and hence the compromise of our repository can only reveal the results of the specified data integration request, while the compromise of central authorities will reveal all data.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/YauY08,130-140,1,IEEE Trans.

1293098,CoopFlow: A Bottom-Up Approach to Workflow Cooperation for Short-Term Virtual Enterprises.,"In a context of short-term cooperation, enterprises with complementary skills are dynamically interconnected according to their needs. To deal with requirements in a such cooperation, we present in this paper CoopFlow that aims at providing a useful artifact for preservation of the privacy of workflows partners, pre-established workflows and pre-established workflow management systems. CoopFlow consists of three steps: workflow abstraction and advertisement, workflow matching and interconnection, and workflow cooperation. To preserve the privacy of partners, the first step of the approach includes an abstraction procedure allowing a partial visibility of the partners' workflows. The second step consists of interconnecting existing workflows of partners with complementary skills attributing to a matching procedure that allows checking both behaviors and business semantics of partners' workflows. Finally, the last step of CoopFlow consists of controlling the inter-enterprise workflows cooperation allowing cooperation partners to integrate the existing workflows and to check whenever they can cooperate and change their partners, which frequently leads to support spontaneous, dynamic and short-term cooperation. With this intention, we developed a platform that manages inter-operability by integrating pre-established workflow management systems. The proof of concept is provided by integrating three heterogeneous and open workflow management systems to the CoopFlow platform.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/TataKM08,214-228,1,IEEE Trans.

1293101,Similarity-Based SOAP Multicast Protocol to Reduce Bandwith and Latency in Web Services.,"Web Services technology provided several advantages over other technologies, however it still has serious limitations, including high latency and high protocol overhead. To improve performance, SOAP network traffic needs to be substantially reduced. This paper presents a novel approach, called similarity-based SOAP multicast protocol (SMP), to address the issue of latency. SMP reduces network traffic by aggregating syntactically similar SOAP messages to form a ""compact SMP message"";. The addresses of clients are encoded as strings in the SMP message header. The similarity of SOAP messages is measured in pairs and is based both on the message template and on the values of each XML tag in the messages. Each XML node in a SOAP message is indexed with an identifier and its position in the SOAP message. Only the indexed form of a SOAP message is sent to clients. Intermediary routers along the paths from server to clients parse the content of each SMP message passing through them and perform necessary operations to forward it to neighbouring routers. Experiments show that SMP can achieve up to 70% reduction in network traffic compared to traditional SOAP unicast.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/PhanTB08,88-103,1,IEEE Trans.

1293102,A Secure Information Flow Architecture for Web Service Platforms.,"Current web service platforms (WSPs) often perform all web services-related processing, including security-sensitive information handling, in the same protection domain. Consequently, the entire WSP may have access to security-sensitive information, forcing us to trust a large and complex piece of software. To address this problem, we propose ISO-WSP, a new information flow architecture that decomposes current WSPs into a small trusted T-WSP to handle security-sensitive data and a large, legacy untrusted U-WSP that provides the normal WSP functionality. To achieve end-to-end security, the application code is also decomposed into a small trusted part and the remaining untrusted code. The trusted part encapsulates all accesses to security-sensitive data through a Secure Functional Interface (SFI). To ease the migration of legacy applications to ISO-WSP, we developed tools to translate direct manipulations of security-sensitive data by the untrusted part into SFI invocations. Using a prototype implementation based on the Apache Axis2 WSP, we show that ISO-WSP reduces software complexity of trusted components by a factor of five, while incurring a modest performance overhead of few milliseconds per request. We also show that existing applications can be migrated to run on ISO-WSP with a few tens of lines of new and modified code.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/WeiSP08,75-87,1,IEEE Trans.

1293103,Dissemination Protocols for Event-Based Service-Oriented Architectures.,"The Event-driven, or notification-based, paradigm has attracted much research interest in areas such as distributed systems, databases, workflow, and grid computing. However, little attention was devoted to event-driven Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs). In this paper, we propose a novel framework for event-based interactions in SOAs. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we introduce various notification patterns for event-driven SOAs. We define two taxonomies for dissemination protocols in SOAs: the interaction taxonomy identifies the different models through which Web services interact with each other; and the filtering taxonomy classifies the events and services involved during dissemination. Second, we propose a dissemination pattern called implicit notification. In contrast to publish-subscribe, implicit notification does not require consumers to explicitly subscribe with producers. We define a model for implicit notifications and introduce a family of protocols for enabling this pattern. Finally, we describe a prototype implementation for a disaster management case study and conduct experiments to assess the performance of the proposed protocols.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/Medjahed08,155-168,1,IEEE Trans.

1293104,Selective Querying for Adapting Web Service Compositions Using the Value of Changed Information.,"Web service composition (WSC) techniques assume that the parameters used to model the environment remain static and accurate throughout the composition's execution. However, WSCs often operate in environments where the parameters of its component services are volatile. To remain optimal, WSCs must adapt to these changes. Adaptation requires up-to-date knowledge about the revised parameters of each of the services. One way of obtaining this knowledge is to query services for their revised parameters. Querying services for their parameters is time-consuming and expensive. We must therefore carefully manage how queries are conducted. Specifically, an adaptive WSC must know when to query for revised information, and from which service(s) to obtain information. We present a method to selectively query services using the value of changed information (VOC). VOC measures the value of the change that revised information may potentially introduce to the composition. We reduce the complexity of computing the VOC, first by anticipating values of the service parameters that do not change the WSC, and second by using parameter expiration times obtained from predefined service-level agreements. Using two scenarios, we illustrate our approach and demonstrate the computational savings theoretically and experimentally.",2008,3/9/16,journals/tsc/HarneyD08,169-185,1,IEEE Trans.

1293105,A Distributed System for Consuming Web Services and Caching Their Responses in MANETs.,"Due to the widespread of different types of hand-held computing devices whose bandwidth, memory size, and processing capacity are becoming comparable to those of desktop computers, mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) applications can now make use of proven distributed computing paradigms, in particular, web services. Indeed, in MANET environments, mobile computing devices can invoke web services methods to gain access to needed data, like stock quotes, currency exchange rates, etc. However, in addition to the communication costs, device mobility can cause temporary loss of connectivity to the server, thus rendering needed services inaccessible during those periods. For such reasons, caching of web service responses within the MANET can become beneficial for increasing data availability and reducing delays. This paper describes a distributed system designed for MANET environments to cache proxies of consumed web services and responses of their invoked methods. Furthermore, it analyzes the analytical and experimental performance of the system, and demonstrates the savings that could be realized after implementing it.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/ArtailS09,17-33,2,IEEE Trans.

1293106,A QoS Control Mechanism to Provide Service Differentiation and Overload Protection to Internet Scalable Servers.,"Nowadays, enterprises providing services through Internet often require online services supplied by other enterprises. This entails the cooperation of enterprise servers using Web services technology. The service exchange between enterprises must be carried out with a determined level of quality, which is usually established in a service level agreement (SLA). However, the fulfilment of SLAs is not an easy task and requires equipping the servers with special control mechanisms which control the quality of the services supplied. The first contribution of this research work is the analysis and definition of the main requirements that these control mechanisms must fulfil. The second contribution is the design of a control mechanism which fulfils these requirements and overcomes numerous deficiencies posed by previous mechanisms. The designed mechanism provides differentiation between distinct categories of service consumers as well as protection against server overloads. Furthermore, it scales in a cluster and does not require any modification to the system software of the host server, or to its application logic.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/GarciaGEGVGC09,16-Mar,2,IEEE Trans.

1293107,Situ: A Situation-Theoretic Approach to Context-Aware Service Evolution.,"Evolvability is essential for computer systems to adapt to the dynamic and changing requirements in response to instant or delayed feedback from a service environment that nowadays is becoming more and more context aware; however, current context-aware service-centric models largely lack the capability to continuously explore human intentions that often drive system evolution. To support service requirements analysis of real-world applications for services computing, this paper presents a situation-theoretic approach to human-intention-driven service evolution in context-aware service environments. In this study, we give situation a definition that is rich in semantics and useful for modeling and reasoning human intentions, whereas the definition of intention is based on the observations of situations. A novel computational framework is described that allows us to model and infer human intentions by detecting the desires of an individual as well as capturing the corresponding context values through observations. An inference process based on Hidden Markov Model makes instant definition of individualized services at runtime possible, and significantly, shortens service evolution cycle. We illustrate the possible applications of this framework through a smart home example aimed at supporting independent living of elderly people.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/ChangJMO09,261-275,2,IEEE Trans.

1293108,Resilience Metrics for Service-Oriented Networks: A Service Allocation Approach.,We develop a graph-theoretic model for service-oriented networks and propose metrics that quantify the resilience of such networks under node and edge failures. These metrics are based on the topological structure of the network and the manner in which services are distributed over the network. We present efficient algorithms to determine the maximum number of node and edge failures that can be tolerated by a given service-oriented network. These algorithms rely on known algorithms for computing minimum cuts in graphs. We also present efficient algorithms for optimally allocating services over a given network so that the resulting service-oriented network can tolerate single node or edge failures. These algorithms are derived through a careful analysis of the decomposition of the underlying network into appropriate types of connected components.,2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/RosenkrantzGRG09,183-196,2,IEEE Trans.

1293110,Configurable Composition and Adaptive Provisioning of Web Services.,"Web services composition has been an active research area over the last few years. However, the technology is still not mature yet and several research issues need to be addressed. In this paper, we describe the design of CCAP, a system that provides tools for adaptive service composition and provisioning. We introduce a composition model where service context and exceptions are configurable to accommodate needs of different users. This allows for reusability of a service in different contexts and achieves a level of adaptiveness and contextualization without recoding and recompiling of the overall composed services. The execution semantics of the adaptive composite service is provided by an event-driven model. This execution model is based on Linda Tuple Spaces and supports real-time and asynchronous communication between services. Three core services, coordination service, context service, and event service, are implemented to automatically schedule and execute the component services, and adapt to user configured exceptions and contexts at run time. The proposed system provides an efficient and flexible support for specifying, deploying, and accessing adaptive composite services. We demonstrate the benefits of our system by conducting usability and performance studies.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/ShengBMN09,34-49,2,IEEE Trans.

1293111,Personalized Recommendation over a Customer Network for Ubiquitous Shopping.,"Personalization services in a ubiquitous computing environmentâ€”ubiquitous personalization services computingâ€”are expected to emerge in diverse environments. Ubiquitous personalization must address limited computational power of personal devices and potential privacy issues. Such characteristics require managing and maintaining a client-side recommendation model for ubiquitous personalization. To implement the client-side recommendation model, this paper proposes Buying-net, a customer network in ubiquitous shopping spaces. Buying-net is operated in a community, called the Buying-net space, of devices, customers, and services that cooperate together to achieve common goals. The customers connect to the Buying-net space using their own devices that contain software performing tasks of learning the customers' preferences, searching for similar customers for network formation, and generating recommendation lists of items. Buying-net attempts to improve recommendation accuracy with less computational time by focusing on local relationship of customers and newly obtained information. We experimented with such customer networks in the area of multimedia content recommendation and validated that Buying-net outperformed a typical collaborative-filtering-based recommender system on accuracy as well as computational time. This shows that Buying-net has good potential to be a system for ubiquitous shopping.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/KimKR09,140-151,2,IEEE Trans.

1293112,Mixed-Integer Programming for QoS-Based Web Service Matchmaking.,"QoS-based Web Service (WS) discovery has been recognized as the main solution for filtering and selecting between functionally equivalent WSs stored in registries or other types of repositories. There are two main techniques for QoS-based WS matchmaking (filtering): ontology-based and Constraint Programming (CP)-based. Unfortunately, the first technique is not efficient as it is based on the rather immature technology of ontology reasoning, while the second one is not accurate as it is based on syntactic QoS-based descriptions and faulty matchmaking metrics. In our previous work, we have developed an extensible and rich ontology language for QoS-based WS description. Moreover, we have devised a semantic alignment algorithm for aligning QoS-based WS descriptions so as to increase the accuracy of QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms. Finally, we have developed two alternative CP-based QoS-based WS matchmaking algorithms: a unary-constrained and n-ary-constrained one. In this paper, we claim that Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) should be used as a matchmaking technique instead of CP and we provide experimental results proving it. In addition, we analyze and experimentally evaluate our matchmaking algorithms against a competing techniques one in order to demonstrate their efficiency and accuracy.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/KritikosP09,122-139,2,IEEE Trans.

1293113,Service Mining on the Web.,"The Web is transforming from a Web of data to a Web of both Semantic data and services. This trend is providing us with increasing opportunities to compose potentially interesting and useful services from existing services. While we may not sometimes have the specific queries needed in top-down service composition approaches to identify them, the early and proactive exposure of these opportunities will be key to harvest the great potential of the large body of Web services. In this paper, we propose a Web service mining framework that allows unexpected and interesting service compositions to automatically emerge in a bottom-up fashion. We present several mining techniques aiming at the discovery of such service compositions. We also present evaluation measures of their interestingness and usefulness. As a novel application of this framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness and potential by applying it to service-oriented models of biological processes for the discovery of interesting and useful pathways.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/ZhengB09,65-78,2,IEEE Trans.

1293114,Choreographing Web Services.,"This paper introduces the Multiagent Protocols (MAP) Web service choreography language and demonstrates how service choreographies can be specified, verified, and enacted with a comparatively simple process language. MAP is a directly executable specification, services do not have to be preconfigured at design-time. Instead, a choreography, specified in MAP, can be sent dynamically to a group of distributed peers to execute at runtime. Furthermore, MAP is based on a formal foundation, this allows model checking of the choreography definition prior to live distribution and enactment. A motivating scenario, taken from the AstroGrid science use-cases, serves as the focal point for the paper and highlights the benefits of choreography, through data flow optimization and lack of centralized server. The MAP formal syntax and model checking environment are discussed in the context of the motivating scenario, along with MagentA, an implementation of MAP which provides a concrete, and open-source framework for the enactment of distributed choreographies. MAP is evaluated by demonstrating the languages conformance to the Service Interaction Patterns, a collection of 13 recurring workflow patterns.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/BarkerWR09,152-166,2,IEEE Trans.

1293117,Mismatch Patterns and Adaptation Aspects: A Foundation for Rapid Development of Web Service Adapters.,"Standardization in Web services simplifies integration. However, it does not remove the need for adapters due to possible heterogeneity among service interfaces and protocols. In this paper, we characterize the problem of Web services adaptation focusing on business interfaces and protocols adapters. Our study shows that many of the differences between business interfaces and protocols are recurring. We introduce mismatch patterns to capture these recurring differences and to provide solutions to resolve them. We leverage mismatch patterns for service adaptation with two approaches: by developing stand-alone adapters and via service modification. We then dig into the notion of adaptation aspects that, following aspect-oriented programming paradigm and service modification approach, allow for rapid development of adapters. We present a study showing that it is a preferable approach in many cases. The proposed approach is implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype tool, and evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative methods.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/KongdenfhaNBCS09,94-107,2,IEEE Trans.

Based on this evaluation of existing approaches and additional sources, we close this gap by proposing an integrated, consolidated approach to business and software service analysis that combines and extends the strengths of the examined methodologies.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/KohlbornKCR09,50-64,2,IEEE Trans.

1293120,Discovering Homogeneous Web Service Community in the User-Centric Web Environment.,"The Web has undergone a tremendous change toward a highly user-centric environment. Millions of users can participate and collaborate for their own interests and benefits. Services Computing paradigm together with the proliferation of Web services have created great potential opportunities for the users, also known as service consumers, to produce value-added services by means of service discovery and composition. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach to facilitating the service consumer on discovering Web services. First, we analyze the service discovery requirements from the service consumer's perspective and outline a conceptual model of homogeneous Web service communities. The homogeneous service community contains two types of discovery: the search of similar operations and that of composible operations. Second, we describe a similarity measurement model for Web services by leveraging the metadata from WSDL, and design a graph-based algorithm to support both of the two discovery types. Finally, adopting the popular atom feeds, we design a prototype to facilitate the consumers to discover while subscribing Web services in an easy-of-use manner. With the experimental evaluation and prototype demonstration, our approach not only alleviates the consumers from time-consuming discovery tasks but also lowers their entry barrier in the user-centric Web environment.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/LiuHM09,167-181,2,IEEE Trans.

1293121,Toward Development of Adaptive Service-Based Software Systems.,"The rapid adoption of service-oriented architecture (SOA) in many large-scale distributed applications requires the development of adaptive service-based software systems (ASBS) with the capability of monitoring the changing system status, analyzing, and controlling tradeoffs among various quality-of-service (QoS) aspects, and adapting service configurations to satisfy multiple QoS requirements simultaneously. In this paper, our results toward the development of adaptive service-based software systems are presented. The formulation of Activity-State-QoS (ASQ) models and how to use the data from controlled experiments to establish ASQ models for capturing the cause-effect dynamics among service activities, system resource states, and QoS in service-based systems are presented. Then, QoS monitoring modules based on ASQ models and SOA-compliant simulation models are developed to support the validation of the ASBS design. The main idea for developing QoS adaptation modules based on ASQ models is discussed. An experiment based on a voice communication service is used to illustrate our results.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/YauYSHRBM09,247-260,2,IEEE Trans.

1293122,A Reference Architecture for Scientific Workflow Management Systems and the VIEW SOA Solution.,"Scientific workflows have recently emerged as a new paradigm for scientists to formalize and structure complex and distributed scientific processes to enable and accelerate many scientific discoveries. In contrast to business workflows, which are typically control flow oriented, scientific workflows tend to be dataflow oriented, introducing a new set of requirements for system development. These requirements demand a new architectural design for scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs). Although several SWFMSs have been developed that provide much experience for future research and development, a study from an architectural perspective is still missing. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) based on a comprehensive survey of the literature and identification of key requirements for SWFMSs, we propose the first reference architecture for SWFMSs; 2) according to the reference architecture, we further propose a service-oriented architecture for View (a VIsual sciEntific Workflow management system); 3) we implemented View to validate the feasibility of the proposed architectures; and 4) we present a View-based scientific workflow application system (SWFAS), called FiberFlow, to showcase the application of our View system.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/LinLFCPLFH09,79-92,2,IEEE Trans.

1293123,Runtime Monitoring of Web Service Conversations.,"For a system of distributed processes, correctness can be ensured by (statically) checking whether their composition satisfies properties of interest. However, Web services are distributed processes that dynamically discover properties of other Web services. Since the overall system may not be available statically and since each business process is supposed to be relatively simple, we propose to use runtime monitoring of conversations between partners as a means of checking behavioral correctness of the entire Web service system. Specifically, we identify a subset of UML 2.0 Sequence Diagrams as a property specification language and show that it is sufficiently expressive for capturing safety and liveness properties. By transforming these diagrams to automata, we enable conformance checking of finite execution traces against the specification.

1293124,Optimizing Service Systems Based on Application-Level QoS.,"Making software systems service-oriented is becoming the practice, and an increasingly large number of service systems play important roles in today's business and industry. Currently, not enough attention has been paid to the issue of optimization of service systems. In this paper, we argue that the key elements to be considered in optimizing service systems are robustness, system orientation, and being dynamic and transparent. We present our solution to optimizing service systems based on application-level QoS management. Our solution incorporates three capabilities, i.e., 1) the ability to cater to the varying rigidities on Web service QoS in distinct application domains and of various users in a robust and heuristic manner, 2) the ability to formulate the overall system utility of a service system perceived by a particular system end user and to suggest its maximization using a utility model incorporated into a three-dimensional weighting scheme, and 3) the ability to dynamically achieve a higher perceived system utility of a service system via transparent negotiations. The calculation of the system utility encompasses a negotiation algorithm and a robust search algorithm for selecting heuristically best Web services. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and our solution is demonstrated by simulation experiments and our demo deployment, SSO.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/LiangWL09,108-121,2,IEEE Trans.

1293125,Context-Based Matching and Ranking of Web Services for Composition.,"In this work, we propose a two-step, context-based semantic approach to the problem of matching and ranking Web services for possible service composition. We present an analysis of different methods for classifying Web services for possible composition and supply a context-based semantic matching method for ranking these possibilities. Semantic understanding of Web services may provide added value by identifying new possibilities for compositions of services. The semantic matching ranking approach is unique since it provides the Web service designer with an explicit numeric estimation of the extent to which a possible composition â€œmakes sense.â€ù First, we analyze two common methods for text processing, TF/IDF and context analysis; and two types of service description, free text and WSDL. Second, we present a method for evaluating the proximity of services for possible compositions. Each Web service WSDL context descriptor is evaluated according to its proximity to other services' free text context descriptors. The methods were tested on a large repository of real-world Web services. The experimental results indicate that context analysis is more useful than TF/IDF. Furthermore, the method evaluating the proximity of the WSDL description to the textual description of other services provides high recall and precision results.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/SegevT09,210-222,2,IEEE Trans.

1293126,The Design and Evaluation of MPI-Style Web Services.,"In this paper, we introduce MPI-style Web service (MPIWS), a novel service presented as a standard Web service but integrated with MPI programming technologies to allow Web applications to run in parallel over a loosely coupled distributed environment. MPIWS takes advantage of the SOAP communication protocol, and allows direct MPI-style communication among loosely coupled services. The MPI-style communication supported by MPIWS includes both point-to-point and collective communications. In this paper, point-to-point and collective communication operations are evaluated in comparison with mpiJava. The evaluation results demonstrate that although the overhead of SOAP messaging takes a toll on performance, MPIWS is generally comparable with mpiJava sending Object data types, especially for coarse-grain applications, and outperforms mpiJava in some cases.",2009,9/6/16,journals/tsc/CooperW09,197-209,2,IEEE Trans.

1343602,From Web Service Artifact to a Readable and Verifiable Model.,"Models of Web service compositions that are both readable and verifiable will benefit organizations that integrate purportedly reusable Web services. Colored Petri nets (CPNs) are at once verifiable and visually expressive, capable of presenting subtle flaws in service composition. Constructing CPN models from Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) artifacts had been a manual process requiring human judgment. Building on results from the Workflow Community, we automate the mapping of artifacts written in BPEL to models used by CPN Toolsâ€”a formal verification environment for development, simulation, and model checking of colored Petri nets. We extend related work that already converts BPEL to Petri nets, to reflect hierarchy and data type (color in CPN terminology), while improving model layout. We present a prototype implementation that mines both a BPEL artifact and the Petri net generated from it by an existing tool. The prototype partitions the Petri net into subnets, lays them out, colors them, and generates their XML file for import into CPN Tools. Our results include depictions of subnets produced and initial simulation results for a well-known case study.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/SloanK09,277-288,2,IEEE Trans.

1343603,An Online Monitoring Approach for Web Service Requirements.,"Web service technology aims to enable the interoperation of heterogeneous systems and the reuse of distributed functions in an unprecedented scale and has achieved significant success. There are still, however, challenges to realize its full potential. One of these challenges is to ensure the behavior of Web services consistent with their requirements. Monitoring events that are relevant to Web service requirements is, thus, an important technique. This paper introduces an online monitoring approach for Web service requirements. It includes a pattern-based specification of service constraints that correspond to service requirements, and a monitoring model that covers five kinds of system events relevant to client request, service response, application, resource, and management, and a monitoring framework in which different probes and agents collect events and data that are sensitive to requirements. The framework analyzes the collected information against the prespecified constraints, so as to evaluate the behavior and use of Web services. The prototype implementation and experiments with a case study shows that our approach is effective and flexible, and the monitoring cost is affordable.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/WangSDLLHM09,338-351,2,IEEE Trans.

Ontology defines a set of representational primitives with which a domain of knowledge is modeled. The main purpose of the Semantic Web and ontology is to integrate heterogeneous data and enable interoperability among disparate systems. Ontology has been used to model software engineering knowledge by denoting the artifacts that are designed or produced during the engineering process. The Semantic Web allows publishing reusable software engineering knowledge resources and providing services for searching and querying. This paper classifies the ontologies developed for software engineering, reviews the current efforts on applying the Semantic Web techniques on different software engineering aspects, and presents the benefits of their applications.

1343606,Distributed Management of Concurrent Web Service Transactions.,"Business processes involve dynamic compositions of interleaved tasks. Therefore, ensuring reliable transactional processing of Web services is crucial for the success of Web service-based B2B and B2C applications. But the inherent autonomy and heterogeneity of Web services render the applicability of conventional ACID transaction models for Web services far from being straightforward. Current Web service transaction models relax the isolation property and rely on compensation mechanisms to ensure atomicity of business transactions in the presence of service failures. However, ensuring consistency in the open and dynamic environment of Web services, where interleaving business transactions enter and exit the system independently, remains an open issue. In this paper, we address this problem and propose an architecture that supports concurrency control on the Web services level. An extension to the standard framework for Web service transactions is proposed to enable detecting and handling transactional dependencies between concurrent business transactions. We also present an optimistic protocol for concurrency control that can be deployed in a fully distributed fashion within the proposed architecture. We also empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions in terms of throughput and response time.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/AlrifaiDBN09,289-302,2,IEEE Trans.

1343608,Requirements for QoS-Based Web Service Description and Discovery.,"The goal of Service Oriented Architectures (SOAs) is to enable the creation of business applications through the automatic discovery and composition of independently developed and deployed (Web) services. Automatic discovery of Web Services (WSs) can be achieved by incorporating semantics into a richer WS description model (WSDM) and by the use of Semantic Web (SW) technologies in the WS matchmaking and selection (i.e., discovery) process. A sufficiently rich WSDM should encompass not only functional but also nonfunctional aspects like Quality of Service (QoS). QoS is a set of performance and domain-dependent attributes that has a substantial impact on WS requesters' expectations. Thus, it can be used for distinguishing between many functionally equivalent WSs that are available nowadays. This paper starts by defining QoS in the context of WSs. Its main contribution is the analysis of the requirements for a semantically rich QoS-based WSDM and an accurate, effective QoS-based WS Discovery (WSDi) process. In addition, a road map of extending current WS standard technologies for realizing semantic, functional, and QoS-based WSDi, respecting the above requirements, is presented.",2009,3/9/16,journals/tsc/KritikosP09a,320-337,2,IEEE Trans.

Paths on elevation maps can be characterized by profiles, which describe relative elevation as a function of distance. In this research, we address the inverse of this mapping - given a profile, how to efficiently find paths that could have generated it. This is called the profile query problem. Profiles have a wide variety of uses that include registering tracking information, or even other maps, to a given map. We describe a probabilistic model to characterize the maximal likelihood that a point lying on a path matches the query profile. Propagation of such probabilities to neighboring points can effectively prune the search space. This model enables us to efficiently answer queries of arbitrary profiles with user-specified error tolerances.

The comparison between our scheme and another chase based scheme, the B-Chase detector, which was originally proposed for improving the performance of the vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) system, is also presented. The problem existing in the B-Chase detector is the criterion for selecting the weakest symbol. In our scheme, a more reasonable selection criterion is proposed.

In order to approach the inversion exactly in operation of the motor, the control method online learning based on NNI system is proposed, in which connection value can be amended continuously online to make the NN adapt to the changes of environment to strengthen its robustness.

Now many physicochemical parameters are available in clinic. There exists great correlation between TCM syndromes and physicochemical parameters. The objective of the paper is to analyze the correlation between TCM syndromes and physicochemical parameters quantitatively and find the most informative physicochemical parameter combination which is useful in differentiation of syndromes. A novel definition of correlation degree based on Renyi's entropy is proposed which can measure the correlation between variables efficiently.

In this paper, we present ViPen model, and illustrate its operations to enhance the provenance for flexible deviation in service composition.

1509064,Improve Service Interface Adaptation Using Sub-ontology Extraction.,"Interface mismatches are common among web services interactions. It happens when the interacting services have different message signatures. Semantic Web technologies are proposed to address this problem. If services are annotated with shared ontologies, an interface adapter may be generated by connecting messages that annotated with same or similar concepts. Unfortunately, services are usually annotated with different ontologies. As a result, different ontologies need to be aligned before adaptation. Aligning large ontologies can be time-consuming and inaccurate, which leads to inefficient and unsuccessful web service adaptation. In this paper, we tackle the problem by proposing a sub-ontology extraction method to generate Representation Ontology for each service. The Representation Ontologies can significantly increase alignment speed and accuracy, which consequently improve the process of interface adapter generation.

1509065,A Link Obfuscation Service to Detect Webbots.,"Web bot fraud activity currently accounts for a large number of web accesses. Current resistance methods such as CAPTCHA are not applicable for bot detection at the granularity of each click. In this paper, we propose a service that counters web bots which mimic human clicks by walking random links. We base our defense on systematically applying link obfuscation. The obfuscation is designed as a service that can be applied to websites without changes from web developers and without changing the behavior of human users. The service for resisting web bots is called Decoy Link Design Adaptation (DLDA) and works by transparently modifying every page of a protected website. The modifications are made such that walking web bots cannot traverse valid paths through the website. Specifically, DLDA modifies each original link on the page surrounding it with a group of invalid links. These obsfucated links are carefully styled to be unnoticed or avoided by human users; however, they require significant effort for programs (bots) to identify. Experiments show that DLDA has a very high detection rate for web bots and near zero false positives. DLDA can detect 80% of walking bots ending a session after one minute of inactivity (no clicks). The detection rate increases to 100% when the session is ended where multiple visits of the bots can be grouped into a single session.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

They constitute the market where service consumers and providers go to search and advertise Web services. With the proliferation of Web service registries, finding an adequate registry has become a complex task for a service requester. In this paper we propose a semantic model for Web services registry description (WSRD). WSRD descriptions depict the functionalities offered by services advertised by a given registry since they rely on these descriptions. We also propose a functionality-driven clustering approach for distributed Web service registries. This approach is based on a fuzzy clustering technique and allows structuring distributed registries based on their WSRD descriptions without any additional data. This clustering will be helpful for selecting an adequate registry for service requesters.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509067,Extensible and General Service-Oriented Platform: Experience with the Service Abstract Machine.,"Services are successful for applications with high levels of dynamicity and interoperability. Ironically the actual Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) technologies are such that interoperability is problematic if different platforms are used simultaneously, and dedicated tools for the support of most engineering tasks are essentially missing. We address the interoperability issue through the definition of a Service Abstract Machine (SAM) that observes a set of heterogeneous service platforms running on different machines and dynamically builds a reliable and homogeneous model of the global state. Conversely, changes in the state model, through SAM API are dynamically translated into the corresponding action(s) in the actual underlying SOC platforms. Evolution, extensibility and engineering support are addressed by dedicated software engineering environments that fully rely on the state model, as if SAM were a real SOC platform. The paper discusses the challenges we faced and the limits of our approach. We show how the system has been implemented, and we draw the early lessons of SAM second year of use.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509068,Universal Identity Management Model Based on Anonymous Credentials.,"The relationship-focused and credential-focused identity management are both user-centric notions in Service-oriented architecture (SOA). For composite services, pure user-centric identity management is inefficient because each sub-service may authenticate and authorize users and users need participate in every identity provisioning transaction. If the above two paradigms are unified into the universal identity management model where identity information and privileges are delegatable, user-centricity will be more feasible in SOA. This paper aims to extend WS-Federation to build a universal identity management model based on anonymous credentials, which provides the delegation of anonymous credentials and combines identity metasystem to support easy-to-use, consistent experience and transparent security. In addition, the concept of self-generated pseudonym is introduced to construct efficient anonymous delegation model.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

An intrinsic subsequence means that all items in it are always present together as a whole in the sequence. The total number of an intrinsic subsequence appeared in a sequence is referred to as absolute support. The intrinsic subsequences with approximate absolute support form a layer. A sequence is supposed to be composed of a set of intrinsic subsequences. And the anomalies are always shown as a composition of some unusual intrinsic subsequences. The abnormal sequence can be detected by decomposing the sequence into a number of layers and finding the differences of the corresponding layers between the normal and suspect sequence data.

One of the most relevant issues is the need of effective, flexible, reliable, low cost solutions for dynamic service brokering and composition. This paper presents results of an ongoing work on the design and development of a service- and message-oriented middleware for atomic and composite service brokering, named SAI middleware. The SAI middleware offers a set of features for service brokering and dynamic composition, while also guaranteeing loose coupling between service providers and consumers and relaxing the prerequisites for service providers to publish their capabilities in an interoperability domain. SAI dynamic composition is based on an Artificial Intelligence planning approach and on the adoption of an ontology-based functional profile encoding information for enabling automatic information extraction and combination in the service composition chain. Our main contribution consists in addressing these issues in a holistic way, as required to effectively support the SOA vision in real application scenarios, while not optimizing single aspects yet.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509072,Applying Bargaining Game Theory to Web Services Negotiation.,"Service Level Agreements (SLAs) have obvious value for Service-Oriented Computing and have received attention from both academics and industry. However, SLAs still lack a theoretical basis and effective techniques to facilitate automatic SLA establishment. In this paper, we classify negotiations into four types, and focus on the 1-to-1 Web services negotiation between a single service provider and a single service consumer. We make three contributions. Firstly, we represent the 1-to-1 Web services negotiation as a bargaining game. Here, we are interested in a bargain that takes into account the interests of both a service provider and a service consumer, in other words, a fair solution. Secondly, we determine a Nash equilibrium that can be regarded as the fair solution to a two-player bargaining game. We also determine the fair solution to the 1-to-1 Web services negotiation. Finally, we discuss issues that may arise with the 1-to-1 Web services negotiation under credible threats, incomplete information, time constraints, and multiple attributes.

Resource Description Framework is frequently used to represent provenance based on vocabularies such as the Open Provenance Model. For complex scientific workflows that generate large amounts of RDF triples, single-machine provenance management becomes inadequate over time. In this paper, we research how HBase Bigtable-like capabilities can be leveraged for distributed storage and querying of provenance data represented in RDF. In particular, we architect the ProvBase system that incorporates an HBase/Hadoop backend, propose a storage schema to hold provenance triples, and design querying algorithms to evaluate SPARQL queries in the system.

1509074,Smarter Heuristics for Business-Driven Services Selection in Multi-services P2P Grids.,"In peer-to-peer (P2P) grids, peers act both as providers and consumers of the services offered in the system. In these systems, fair and efficient match of service request and service provision can be attained by using simple reciprocation-based mechanisms. Under contention, a peer p gives priority to serve the requests of the peers that have the largest difference between the amount of service provided to p and the amount of service consumed from p in the past, i.e. the peers to whom p owes most. Taking a business-driven approach, peers have a cost for the provision of services, while gain utility for the consumption of services, and the peers' profit is given by the difference between the overall utility attained and the overall cost incurred. It has been shown that if a peer may offer multiple services, then the profit that it can extract from the P2P grid is highly affected by the services that it chooses to offer. Thus, the services selection problem can be formulated as an optimisation problem that seeks to maximise the peers' profit. Unfortunately, due to the many uncertainties that characterise this highly dynamic system, it is not feasible for a peer to deterministically decide what is the optimal selection of services that it should make. Thus, services selection algorithms must be based on heuristics. Some heuristics have been proposed, but although they perform well in a number of scenarios, there are many others in which they fall short. This is basically due to their inability to identify situations in which it would be better not to use their resources to provide services that will not yield any profit in the future. In this paper we use a hill-climbing approach to design smarter heuristics that can provide more profitable selections, when compared to previously proposed ones. Our simulation results show that, in the scenarios evaluated, the new heuristics proposed never perform worse than the best of the previously proposed ones, and can outperform the latter in as much as 281% in the most favourable settings when resources are plentiful.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509075,Formal Passive Testing of Service-Oriented Systems.,"This paper presents a formal framework to perform passive testing of service-oriented systems. Our approach uses the historical interaction files between web services to check the absence of faults. It uses a set of properties, that we call invariants, to represent the most relevant expected behaviour of the web services under test. Intuitively, an invariant expresses the fact that each time the system under test performs a given sequence of actions, it must exhibit a behavior reflected in the invariant. Invariants can be defined from a local point of view, that is, to check properties of isolated web services, and from a global point of view, that is, to check web service interaction properties. In order to increase applicability and adaption to a real environment, we assume that we do not have a global log. We show how to use local logs (recorded in each web service) in order to check local properties and how to combine them in order to check global properties.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Existing approaches focus mainly on defining coarse-grained services corresponding to the key business requirements. An improved migration of legacy systems onto SOA-based systems requires identifying the â€˜optimalâ€™ services with an appropriate level of granularity. This paper proposes a novel framework which identifies the key services effectively. The framework approach focuses on defining these services based on a Model-Driven Architecture approach supported by a SOA meta-model.

1509078,Dynamic Service Invocation Control in Service Composition Environments.,"Service composition environments enable people to create, manage, share services, and compose atomic services for their own requirements. Since users and service entity hosts are always distributed in locations in such environments, service responses might be very slow if users invoke services that are physically far from them, which is even slower for invoking composite services. However, those problems cannot be solved using traditional caching technologies in the areas of contents delivery network because service providers in service composition environments always have their own policies about service license issues, and do not allow their service entities to be copied on all service entity hosts. In this paper, we propose the approach of dynamically switching availability of services among service entity hosts based on the invocation request from users, and design several dynamic invocation control mechanisms to improve the response performance of services considering the service license constraints by service providers. Our proposed mechanisms are evaluated by simulation in service composition environments.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

In this paper, we are interested in precise methods that can characterize the impact of business consolidations on the companiesâ€™ SOA based IT implementation, wherein the service interfaces are explicitly exposed. Our solution is to model the business to SOA dependencies and use the model to analyze IT consolidation choices when triggered by business consolidation decisions.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509081,Correcting Interaction Mismatches for Business Processes.,"Discovering and correcting interaction mismatches in inter-organizational business processes are important for service choreography. Automatic discovery mismatches and providing correcting plans will alleviate burdens on business modelers, however, three major challenges are: 1) by what cost model to evaluate multiple correcting plans; 2) how to avoid generating new mismatches when correcting processses;3) how to effectively reduce the search space size. In this paper, we first extend our previous approach to discover interaction mismatches, and present a cost model for evaluating correcting plans; secondly, we propose an independent modifying region-based method to obtain multiple correcting plans which can avoid generating new mismatches, and reduce the search space for finding out correcting plans. A running example is given to illustrate the validity. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

1509082,Alternative Approaches for Workflow Similarity.,"Service discovery of state dependent services has to take workflow aspects into account. To increase the usability of a service discovery, the result list of services should be ordered with regard to the relevance of the services. Means of ordering a list of workflows is a similarity measure of the workflow and a query. In this paper different similarity measures facilitating structured workflows and higher level change operations are presented and evaluated based on a pilot of an empirical study. In particular the different measures are compared with the study results. It turns out that the quality of the different measures differ significantly. The best results can be achieved by facilitating n-gram multisets as a workflow as a basis for the similarity measure calculations.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509083,A Framework for Shrink-Wrapping Security Services.,"To achieve effective security in the increasingly dynamic computing environment of the mobile workforce our perspectives on security have to change, requiring the development of new approaches.

1509084,Analyzing Communities vs. Single Agent-Based Web Services: Trust Perspectives.,"Gathering functionally similar agent-based Web services into communities has been proposed and promoted on many occasions. In this paper, we compare the performance of these communities with self-managed, single agent-based Web services from trust perspective. To this end, we deploy a reputation model that ranks communities and Web services with respect to different reputation parameters. By relating the parameters, we extend our discussion to analyze the beneficial cases and incentives for a single Web service to join a community even if this joining could negatively impact other parameters. Besides theoretical discussions of this analysis, we discuss the system implementation along with simulations that depict diverse parameters and system performance.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509085,Accountability as a Service for the Cloud.,"Computing resource provisioning through the use of the Cloud computing paradigm has triggered revolutions in modern day computing. It is a new paradigm for deploying services on rented machines. On the other hand, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has gained wide adoption among organizations due to the importance of collaborations and outsourcing. Therefore the Cloudâ€™s enormous capacity with comparable low cost makes it an ideal platform for SOA deployment. The overall correctness of the SOA deployed in the Cloud depends on the correctness of all individual participants. As the SOA usually spans multiple administration domains, concluding the faulty service and making the provider responsible become a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel design to achieve Trustworthy Service Oriented Architecture (TSOA) in the Cloud through enforcing strong accountability. In such system not only the root of a fault can always be concluded to the guilty participant(s), each conclusion is supported with non-disputable evidence. We also implemented a demonstrative system to show its effectiveness in real practice. Our testing figure indicates the cost of incorporating our design to SOA in the cloud is acceptable.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509086,Analyst-Mediated Contextualization of Regulatory Policies.,"Increasing legislative and regulatory concerns have fueled an interest in effective and efficient tools for managing business process compliance within organizations. In particular, the key challenge is to understand high-level compliance policies in natural language, and interpret them for a particular usage context. These interpreted policies can then be represented in a formal language, and used to (for example) automatically verify compliance of business process executions against these policies. In this paper, we focus on the first part of this problem: interpreting regulatory policies â€” called \emph{contextualization}. We employ a natural language parser to extract key phrases from the natural language statements and generate possible interpretations from predefined templates. An analyst chooses interpretations according to the organizational context. These interpretations are then grounded further and represented in a formal language. Via a prototype, we demonstrate our approach on real-life security compliance obligations used within IBM's IT service delivery units.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509087,AHA: Asset Harvester Assistant.,"Information assets in service enterprises are typically available as unstructured documents. There is an increasing need for unraveling information from these documents into a structured and semantic format. Structured data can be more effectively queried, which increases information reuse from asset repositories. This paper addresses the problem of extracting XML models, which follow a given target schema, from enterprise documents. We discuss why existing approaches for information extraction do not suffice for the enterprise documents created during service delivery. To address this limitation, we present the Asset Harvester Assistant (AHA), a tool that automatically extracts structured models from MS-Word documents, and supports manual refinement of the extracted models within an interactive environment. We present the results of empirical studies conducted using business-process documents from real service-delivery engagements. Our results indicate that the AHA approach can be effective in extracting accurate models from unstructured documents and improving user productivity.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509088,Wukong: Toward a Cloud-Oriented File Service for Mobile Devices.,"Along with the rapid growth of heterogeneous cloud services and network technologies, more mobile devices use cloud storage services to enlarge the capacity and share data in our daily lives. We commonly use cloud storage service clients in a straight forward fashion, since we may easily obtain most client-side software from many services providers. However, when more devices and users participate in heterogeneous services, the difficulty increases to manage these services efficiently and conveniently. In this paper we design and implement a novel cloud-oriented file service, Wukong, which provides a user-friendly and highly-available facilitative data access method for mobile devices in cloud settings. By using the innovative storage abstraction layer and a set of optimization strategies, Wukong supports heterogeneous services with a relatively high performance. By evaluating a prototype in a systematic way on the aspects of the supporting interface, system performance, and the system resource cost, we find that this easily operable file service has a high usability and extensibility. It costs about 50 to 150 lines of code to implement a new backend service supporting plugin. Wukong achieves an acceptable throughput of 179.11 KB/s in an ADSL environment and 80.68 KB/s under a country EVDO 3G network with negligible overhead.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509089,An Assessment of Middleware Platforms for Accessing Remote Services.,"Due to the shift from software-as-a-product (SaaP) to software-as-a-service (SaaS), software components that were developed to run in a single address space must increasingly be accessed remotely across the network. Distribution middleware is frequently used to facilitate this transition. Yet a range of middleware platforms exist, and there are few existing guidelines to help the programmer choose an appropriate middleware platform to achieve desired goals for performance, expressiveness, and reliability. To address this limitation, in this paper we describe a case study of transitioning an Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) service from local to remote access. Our case study compares five remote versions of this service, constructed using different distribution middleware platforms. These platforms are implemented by widely-used commercial technologies or have been proposed as improvements on the state of the art. In particular, we implemented a service-oriented version of our own Remote Batch Invocation abstraction. We compare and contrast these implementations in terms of their respective performance, expressiveness, and reliability. Our results can help remote service programmers make informed decisions when choosing middleware platforms for their applications.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509090,Converged Service Delivery: Modeling and Engineering.,"With the success of the network convergence, we have no more difficulty to transport most of contents and deliver any service. However, nowadaysâ€™ users desire to have his own services with a richer media as the content. As a result, it challenges to reconsider a new service paradigm and its delivery. Driven by the trend of different mobility and service ubiquity, the service convergence comes into sight as a promising solution facing the NGS context. Moreover, reengineering is needed for the delivery of the converged services. Existing solutions as IN, SOA and WS have not been able to completely cover all the converged service delivery needs. This paper proposes to redesign the service by modelling its structure and converged interfaces. We proposed a loose coupling between service elements (service composition) as well as a more flexible deployment of services (service aggregation) in order to meet converged service delivery.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509091,Service Supervision for Service-Oriented Collective Intelligence.,"Service-oriented collective intelligence, which creates new value by combining services provided by various organizations via services computing technologies, has been gaining in importance with the development of services computing technologies. Because collective intelligence needs many participants, it is crucial to build a framework where a wide variety of policies of service providers are satisfied. In this paper, we propose an architecture which handles a comprehensive process of service selection, adaptation, and coordination to satisfy policies of service providers. First the system selects services, and then adapts the services to the given policies if any of available services cannot satisfy the policies. To achieve this, we formalized this problem as an extension of constraint satisfaction problem and showed a solution. Moreover, the system often needs to force a composite service to follow protocols given by service providers. Therefore we proposed a method which uses meta-level control functions for composite services in order to change order of service execution.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509092,A Novel Approach to Improving the Efficiency of Storing and Accessing Small Files on Hadoop: A Case Study by PowerPoint Files.,"Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) becomes a representative cloud storage platform, benefiting from its reliable, scalable and low-cost storage capability. HDFS has been utilized in BlueSky, one of the most prevalent e-Learning resource sharing systems in China, to store and share courseware majorly in the form of PowerPoint (PPT) files and video clips. Unfortunately, HDFS does not perform well for massive small files since huge numbers of small files imposed heavy burden on NameNode of HDFS, correlations between files were not considered for data placement, and no prefetching mechanism was provided to improve I/O performance. This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the efficiency of storing and accessing small files on HDFS. Characteristics of file correlations and access locality remaining among small files in the context of courseware are well considered for storing and accessing them. Firstly, all correlated small files of a PPT courseware are merged into a larger file to reduce the metadata burden on NameNode. Secondly, a two-level prefetching mechanism is introduced to improve the efficiency of accessing small files. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is able to effectively mitigate the load of NameNode and to improve the efficiency of storing and accessing massive small files on HDFS.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Given multiple antennas at the base-station (BS) and single antenna subscribers, we focus on maximizing the ergodic system sum capacity and propose an adaptive feedback bit allocation scheme under the constraint of total feedback bandwidth. Furthermore, we develop two efficient feedback allocation schemes based on asymptotic analysis. We present simulation results that verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive allocation schemes.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509094,Graph-Based Cloud Service Placement.,"The emergent IT clouds as the future of datacenters enable considerable opportunities for the services creation, deployment, management and usability. Users all over the world, from individuals to businesses have been taking advantage of the new cloud services automation and scalability benefits. However, the services creation and business support are still dominated by intensive manual labor. Offerings with similar infrastructure requirements and dependencies are mainly built from scratch as separated entities, making the service development inefficient and error prone. We propose a graph based solution for semi-automated service creation, which expresses the mapping between a business support system and an operations support system. We first identify and expose, at the leaf level of our graph, the meaningful IT operations in the form of basic services. Then, we extend our graph by representing existing services offerings in terms of these operation level service definitions as well as simpler services offerings. At service creation time, an offering manager can re-combine existing building blocks to define new services, besides implementing new blocks down to the operations support system. Our solution takes into consideration the constraints and costs of the service offering sub-components as far as their mapping down to datacenter resources for optimizing the service placement into data-centers. We present a study of the Desktop Service use case.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509095,Constructing an Authentication Token to Access External Services in Service Aggregation.,"Service aggregation is becoming a cost-effective and time-efficient way for a business to develop new applications and services. While it creates tremendous opportunities in various industry sectors, its cross-organization nature raises serious challenges in the security domains for authentication. In this paper we formulate a formal definition of authentication in service aggregation and a security model for it, and propose two authentication protocols. One is a one-way protocol and another is an interactive one. In particular, the constructed authentication tokens are anonymous to verifiers. We prove their security, show how to choose optimal system parameters, and analyse the efficiency.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

However, taking a â€œdo-it-yourselfâ€ù approach to the problem is proving to be both expensive and complex. Cloud Computing, with its on-demand provisioning capability on shared resources, has emerged as a new paradigm to address the challenges of the CP industry. In this paper, we describe a framework for deployment of business analytic solutions on a Cloud platform. We illustrate the benefits of the approach in context of the Demand Driven Business Analytic solution that provides demand signals to CP manufacturers.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509097,Preserving Data Flow Correctness in Process Adaptation.,"In services and cloud computing, processes need to be continually adapted to changing environments and requirements. Undisciplined process adaptation could easily lead to data flow anomalies, e.g., input missing for some activities in the process. In this paper, we study the problem of data-flow-correctness-preserving adaptation and propose three important criteria that can maintain the data flow correctness in process adaptation. We demonstrate our approach by using a typical process adaptation scenario in BPEL.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509098,A Service Packaging Platform for Delivering Services.,"For a service to be used in a commercial setting, certain service delivery functions such as monitoring, billing, authentication, etc need to be packaged with the service. Because of the growing number of available services and the diversity in their offerings, predefined service delivery functions like that offered by existing service brokers (e.g. StrikeIron or Salesforce) cannot be easily adapted and plugged in with the core service from a third party provider. The need is to have a lightweight service packaging platform that offers service providers the ability to create reusable service packages by assembling existing service delivery functions or creating new ones. In this paper we introduce the notion of service packages and a pattern-based approach to service packaging. We highlight what is required from a platform to have such service packaging capabilities, and detail a prototype platform that we have developed to meet these requirements.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509099,A QoS Query Language for User-Centric Web Service Selection.,"One of the prerequisites for the success of a QoS-based web service selection process is an accurately formulated QoS query. It is usually not an easy task for users to formulate an accurate query considering the complexity of many current QoS languages and usersâ€™ lack of knowledge on realistic QoS values. It would be very helpful if the system can provide some assistance to users during the whole process. Nonetheless, not many research works put user support to the center of their system design. In this paper we want to tackle this issue by proposing a QoS query language which is expressive while not so complicated, together with a comprehensive user support mechanism to guide users through the query formulation process. A few unique features of the language include its time dimension, user-defined relaxation order which could be different from the preference order, and the support for the mixed fuzzy and range requirement. How to handle these new features is also discussed as case studies in the paper.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509100,A Value-Driven Approach for the Determination of Global Optimization Objective of Service Composition.,"We present a value-driven approach capable of determining the global optimization objective of service composition to satisfy high-level value expectations. In traditional service composition methods, global and local QoS requirements and constraints are directly raised by customers, then a set of service components (web services) are selected to achieve the optimized QoS. Yet in practice, there is no mechanism helping customers accurately and comprehensively determine their QoS desires. In our approach, a customerâ€™s initial expectations of high-level global values are first put forward, and then five types of dependencies between service values are analyzed. Because values are realized under the facilitation of specific service components, value expectations and value dependencies are transformed into the objective and constraints of service selection and composition, respectively. Another feature of our approach is that, besides web services, other generalized service components such as human activity and physical resources are considered as potential components for fulfilling value expectations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a case study of ocean transportation service (OTS).",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

The automated design methods for digital electronics and adaption of them to droplet-based microfluidics are explained.

1509102,Meta-Modeling of Semantic Web Services.,"Web Services Description Language (WSDL) allows a structured way to standardize the description of Web Services, exploiting XML for the exchange of structured information. Nevertheless XML supports little interoperability between services, expected when WSDL documents have to be combined. In this context, the Semantic Web has become a promising research field. Semantic Models (e.g. RDF or OWL) allow knowledge from many different sources to be easily combined so that unexpected data connections can be used. In this paper we provide a description of WSDL documents into a metamodel representation of Semantic Models. It allows interoperability at different levels of abstraction. A Datalog rule based system queries both service description and associated semantic annotations. Such system is built on top of traditional database technology to guarantee an efficient management of Semantic Web Services Descriptions. Finally we present experiments on a real dataset to test the feasibility of the modeling approach.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509103,Towards Self-Aware Performance and Resource Management in Modern Service-Oriented Systems.,"Modern service-oriented systems have increasingly complex loosely-coupled architectures that often exhibit poor performance and resource efficiency and have high operating costs. This is due to the inability to predict at run-time the effect of dynamic changes in the system environment (e.g., varying service workloads) and adapt the system configuration accordingly. In this paper, we describe a long-term vision and approach for designing systems with built-in self-aware performance and resource management capabilities. We advocate the use of architecture-level performance models extracted dynamically from the evolving system configuration and maintained automatically during operation. The models will be exploited at run-time to adapt the system to changes in the environment ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently and performance requirements are continuously satisfied.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509104,Discovering Shared Services from Cross-Organizational Software Specifications.,"During a standard software development process, organizations create text-based documents that describe software requirements, design, and implementation. These text-based specifications describe the functionality of future applications as they relate to an existing IT infrastructure. We suggest that these documents also implicitly describe core underlying service-based capabilities of the organization. In this paper, we describe an approach that (when provided with software specifications from multiple organizations) can recommend services shared by the multiple organizations represented. These approaches leverage the syntactic similarity of the specification text and semantic information as inferred from WordNet. Experiments show the effectiveness of this approach when processing real software requirements specifications in operational environments.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509105,PeopleCloud Service for Enterprise Crowdsourcing.,"Web 2.0 provides the technological foundations upon which the crowdsourcing paradigm evolves and operates, enabling enterprises, universities and eGovernments, to access scalable networks of knowledge experts on-line. However, there is no existing practice allowing for coordination of crowdsourcing tasks, and their integration with existing business processes and embedding these services into the Web fabric. In this paper, we examine two applications of enterprise crowdsourcing service in the domain of IT Service Delivery: 1) IT Inventory Management and 2) End-User Support. We illustrate how a) expert discovery mechanism, b) virtual team building capabilities, c) task management and d) provisioning of task-based services, enable enterprises to effectively build knowledge networks, which are able to execute complex and transformative knowledge-intensive tasks. Finally, based on the application analysis, we propose PeopleCloud, an on-demand service system, which spawns and manages scalable virtual teams of knowledge workers by either (1) building on the wisdom of crowds within an enterprise or across a value chain or (2) creating a marketplace for accessing specialists on-line.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509106,Metaheuristic Optimization of Large-Scale QoS-aware Service Compositions.,"We present an optimization approach for service compositions in large-scale service-oriented systems that are subject to Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. In particular, we leverage a composition model that allows a flexible specification of QoS constraints by using constraint hierarchies. We propose an extensible met heuristic framework for optimizing such compositions. It provides coherent implementation of common met heuristic functionalities, such as the objective function, improved mutation or neighbor generation. We implement three met heuristic algorithms that leverage these improved operations. The experiments show the efficiency of these implementations and the improved convergence behavior compared to purely randomized met heuristic operators.

1509108,A Formal Service Contract Model for Accountable SaaS and Cloud Services.,"Enabled by Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), recently Software as a Service (SaaS) and Cloud computing are gaining momentum in the industry. An open issue is how to ensure accountability in business services offered through Internet. Traditionally a contract is an effective legal means to uphold accountability in business transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel service contract model called OWL-SC for e-Services. Based on OWL-DL and SWRL, OWL-SC model can be used to disclose obligations of both e-Services consumer and e-Services provider. More importantly, the model allows service participants to monitor the service contract execution and keep track of obligation fulfillment for each party during service delivery. We also propose a graphical model SC-CPN based on Colored Petri-Nets (CPN) to formally model contract obligations and their interdependencies. SC-CPN can also be used to validate the correctness of obligations in OWL-SC through simulation and state space analysis. Finally, we use the Congo Book service as an example to illustrate how to use OWL-SC and SC-CPN to build a service contract model.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509109,X-RIME: Cloud-Based Large Scale Social Network Analysis.,"As an important technique in modern sociology, social network analysis has gained a lot of attention from many disciplines, and been used as important complements to traditional statistics and data analysis. In order to make it affordable for analysts with massive and fast growing networks, we present X-RIME, a cloud-based library for large scale social network analysis. We propose an implementation-oriented classification of social network analysis structures and structure variables to guide the implementation of them over MapReduce parallel programming model. The layered architecture of the library is described along with design consideration of each layer. By sharing the same infrastructure and integrating with existing cloud-based data warehouse and data mining libraries and tools, more comprehensive and cost effective social network aware business intelligence solutions could be built. We present several case studies on an online community to illustrate the usage of X-RIME library. The performance of the library is evaluated with experiments, which demonstrates good scalability.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509110,A Knowledge Acquisition Method for Improving Data Quality in Services Engagements.,"Poor Data Quality is a serious problem affecting enterprises. Enterprise databases are large and manual data cleansing is not feasible. For such large databases it is logical to attempt to cleanse the data in an automated way. This has led to the development of commercial tools for automatic cleansing. However, offering data cleansing as a service has been a challenge because of the need to customize the tool for different datasets. This is because current commercial systems lack the ability to incorporate the unique exceptions of different data sources. This makes the migration of underlying data cleansing algorithms from one dataset to another difficult. In this paper we specifically look at the address standardization task. We use Ripple Down Rules (RDR) framework to lower the manual effort required in rewriting the rules from one source to another. The RDR framework allows us to incrementally patch the existing rules or add exceptions without breaking other rules. We compare the RDR approach with a conditional random field (CRF) address standardization system and an existing commercially available data cleansing tool. We demonstrate that RDR is an effective knowledge acquisition method and that its adoption for data cleansing can allow data cleansing to be offered as a service.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509111,Supporting Geosciences Web Services Metadata Management and Discovery.,"Geosciences Web portals are becoming increasingly important for supporting geoscientists in their research. The GEO-SEED portal is a repository of geosciences web services metadata, represented in Resource Description Framework (RDF), which supports management and discovery by machines and automated agents. This project uses SPARQL, the W3C standard for querying RDF, to support discovery of web services. SPARQL query performance becomes more critical as the amount of RDF metadata in the repository increases. Most existing RDF storage systems are based on relational database technology. The problem with most of these systems is that their query performance is limited by the use of fixed schema mapping strategies. In this paper, we present our system, called S2ST, which addresses this issue in the context of geosciences web services metadata management. Our experiments show that S2ST provides better SPARQL performance than existing relational RDF storage systems.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

However, each method is discussed under a certain set of often implicit assumptions or expectations. It has thus not clearly discussed how selection methods and adaptation methods can be chosen and combined in a consistent way with each other and with the target business process. This paper provides an overview of our study toward an analysis, design and implementation framework to promote consistent use of service selection methods and process adaptation methods with different assumptions.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509113,Dynamic Composition of Services in Sensor Networks.,"Service modeling and composition is a fundamental method for offering advanced functionality by combining a set of primitive services provided by the system. Unlike in the case of web services for which there is an abundance of reliable resources, in sensor networks, the resources are constrained and communication among nodes is error-prone and unreliable. Such a dynamic environment requires a continuous adaptation of the composition of services. In this paper, we first propose a graph-based model of sensor services that maps to the operational model of sensor networks and is amenable to analysis. Based on this model, we formulate the process of sensor service composition as a cost-optimization problem, which is NP-complete. We then propose two heuristic methods for its solution, the top-down and the bottom-up, and discuss their centralized and distributed implementations. Using simulations, we evaluate their performance.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

To address this problem, the paper proposes a fine-grain structural concept for traditional service registries, called web service community. Efficient semantic-level service enquiry and community management depend on context information. This paper investigates the issue of context modeling and proposes four categorizations of context information for service composition. Several design issues that relate to these context information are discussed, including community organization, context-aware management and semantic-level web service query.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509116,Utilizing the Waiting-Time Criterion for Selecting Services in a Composition Scenario.,"Service composition is an effective practice to perform complex tasks through varied configurations of simple services. An issue that often arises in such a set-up is the selection of the best service from a group of functionally equivalent ones to cater to each of the various functionalities of the composite application. Previous effort in this direction incorporates utilizing the Quality of Service (QoS) attributes of the services to pick out the best one of the lot. This paper presents a technique to select the optimal service for composition using the average waiting time attribute of the services. The service selected is the one that has the smallest value of the average waiting time. Concepts from queueing theory have been borrowed and customized to estimate the waiting time values of the candidate services. Experiments have been performed wherein selection results using the proposed technique are compared with the selections that are made by simulating an actual scenario and computing the waiting time by observation.

1509117,A Cost-Minimizing Service Composition Selection Algorithm Supporting Time-Sensitive Discounts.,"An attractive business model for service brokers and aggregators is the creation of composite services built from services offered by third parties. These providers generate profits by charging their customers a premium above the charges they themselves pay to the third party providers. When multiple providers offer services with the same or similar functional and non-functional properties, selecting services with lowest associated costs is clearly beneficial. However, this is not a trivial task when, as is often the case, third party providers have complex service charging models incorporating discounts based on the context in which their service is used. This context can refer to, for example, which other services a service is composed with, or the time interval in which the service is invoked. We present a service selection algorithm that takes into account time-sensitive intra and inter provider discounts which serves to minimize the expected cost to the service aggregator of offering a composite service within a specified time interval.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

Cloud computing era calls for a more open content service mode. In order to construct open service relationship, we propose one novel CDN-P2P loosely-coupled SLA negotiation model. CDN firstly needs to provide an open and standard-based agreement interface for the P2P and other applications to negotiate with it. Therefore, we use Web Services Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) for establishing agreement between two CDN and P2P. This scheme also allows CDN easily integrated with other application. The loosely-coupled CDN-P2P-SLA establishment needs to link with SLA performance monitoring, we design WSDM based CDN-P2P loosely coupled SLA monitoring scheme. The prototype system experiments have proved the feasibility of this model and scheme. Finally, we conclude this paper and analyze the prospective research direction.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509119,Discovering Business Process Model from Unstructured Activity Logs.,"Many real world business processes are executed without explicit orchestration and hence do not generate structured execution logs. This is particularly true for the class of business processes which are executed in service delivery centers in emerging markets where rapid changes in processes and in the people executing the processes are common. In such environments, the process execution logs are usually a mix of human entered activity log of actions performed and the auto-generated logs by various tools used during the process execution. Process discovery from unstructured execution logs has been a relatively unexplored research area. In this paper, we propose an approach for process discovery from unstructured logs using gaussian mixture models and hidden markov models. We apply this approach to the logs generated by a real-world business process used in a service delivery center and demonstrate that the results obtained are comparable to an approach of manually labeling the logs followed by a best known process discovery algorithm in literature. The approach proposed is generic and applicable to a wide range of business process execution settings.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509120,Market-Based QoS Control for Voluntary Services.,"With the development of services computing technology, more and more voluntary services have been available on the Internet. When using voluntary services, users tend to obtain higher QoS (e.g., get more computational resources to improve throughput of the services) than they actually need because there is no cost. To control QoS of the voluntary services appropriately, it is necessary to design resource allocation mechanism using utilities on both service users and providers. Therefore, we have proposed market-oriented resource allocation where users and providers exchange system resources and QoS based on their utilities. In our proposed approach, service users obtain more utilities if higher QoS is allocated according to their preferences in using the services, while service providers get more utilities if their services are more effectively used by their preferred users. In order to validate the proposed method, we have compared market-based approach with demand-based approach by simulation. The simulation results show that our approach motivated users to give true demands more than demand-based approach.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509121,Using Complex Event Processing for Dynamic Business Process Adaptation.,"As the amount of data generated by today's pervasive environments increases exponentially, there is a stronger need to decipher the important information that is hidden among it. By using complex event processing, we can obtain the information that really matters to our organization and use it to improve our processes. However, even when this information is retrieved, business processes remain static and cannot be changed dynamically to adapt to the actual scenario, diminishing the advantages that can be achieved. In this paper we present CEVICHE, a framework that combines the strengths of complex event processing and dynamic business process adaptation, which allows to respond to the needs of today's rapidly changing environments. We use a simple car rental scenario to show how CEVICHE could be used to maintain the quality of service of a business process by adapting it according to the situation.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509122,A Trust Ontology for Semantic Services.,"We propose a novel semantic service trust organization that uses an ontological approach to model service trust. In particular, our ontology-based organization supports various trust phases including trust bootstrapping, atomic service trust, trust composition and trust propagation. We describe the implementation of the proposed trust organization.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509123,Legacy Asset Analysis and Integration in Model-Driven SOA Solution.,"In this paper, we study legacy asset reuse for SOA design. Typically, the cost of reusing legacy assets is much lower than the cost of creating new services from scratch. As an extension of our SOA service modeling, we use top-down approaches to identify business services, and use asset modeling for legacy asset identification to find potential reusable assets for those services. Using service capacity analysis, we evaluate the maturity of a legacy asset for transformation to a service. Finally, we provide a model transformation to convert a service model with legacy assets into an SOA reference architecture model. Our effort integrates asset reuse as a part of the overall SOA design cycle and increases the possibility of asset reuse. To help architects use our method in engineering practice, we have implemented our method in the SOMA-ME tooling environment.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509124,Mobile Process Management through Web Services.,"Nowadays, process-aware information systems (PAISs) are widely used for the management of â€œadministrativeâ€ù processes characterized by clear and well-defined structures. Besides those scenarios, PAISs can be used also in mobile and pervasive scenarios, where process participants can be only equipped with smart devices, such as PDAs. This paper illustrates ROME4EU, a fully-fledged PAIS that can be entirely developed on Windows Mobile PDAs. To our knowledge, all existing PAISs are equipped with an engine meant to run only on laptop/desktop. And this prevents them from being used in mobile scenarios, such as emergency management. ROME4EU is based on a mobile Web service middleware and a WS-BPEL orchestrator engine. The feasibility for mobile settings introduces new challenging issues to face with, such as reduced computational power, small screen size, battery consumption, automatic adaptability to anomalous events. The paper details also an evaluation of the ROME4EUâ€™s performances and illustrates its use by civil protection operators to manage the aftermath of a (simulated) emergency.

1509125,An Ontology to Support Context-Aware B2B Services.,"In present day globalised trade, the ability to support collaboration through B2B (Business-to-Business) services is crucial. One of the key challenges is to pervasively connect partners across the entire value chain, with the appropriate service offerings. Thus, it is vital to quickly identify potential partners to form new B2B collaborations or to support formed collaborations with swift decision making abilities. This paper proposes the use of Description Logic (DL) based reasoning to ensure completeness and decidability in reasoning for context-aware B2B services. A B2B Context Model is realised through a DL-based representation language called OWL (Web Ontology Language). The expressivity of OWL was extended through the SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language), to represent business rules identified in the model. The performance scalability of an ontology-based knowledge base using OWL was then investigated. Results showed that such a knowledge base is not scalable.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509126,Detection of Semantically Equivalent Fragments for Business Process Model Change Management.,"Modern business process modeling environments support distributed development by means of model version control, i.e., comparison and merging of two different model versions. This is a challenging task since most modeling languages support an almost arbitrary creation of process models. Thus, in multi-developer environments, process models or parts of them are often syntactically very different but semantically equivalent. Hence, the comparison of business process models must be performed on a semantic level rather then on a syntactic level. For the domain of business process modeling, this problem is yet unsolved. This paper describes an approach that allows the semantic comparison of different business process models using a normal form. For that purpose, the process models are fully automatically translated into process model terms and normalized using a term rewriting system. The resulting normal forms can be efficiently compared and easily be used for reconciliation. Our approach enables the semantic comparison of business process models ignoring syntactic redundancies.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509127,Towards Green Business Process Management.,"There is a global consensus on the need to reduce our collective carbon footprint. While much research attention has focused on developing alternative energy sources, automotive technologies or waste disposal techniques, we often ignore the fact that the ability to optimize (existing) operations to reduce their emissions impact is fundamental to this exercise. We believe that by transforming the problem into the domain of Business Process Management (BPM) we can leverage the rich expertise in this field to address issues associated with identifying areas for improvement, understanding the implication and performing carbon footprint minimization. We will use the term ``Green BPM'' to describe a novel class of technologies that leverage and extend existing BPM technology to enable process design, analysis, execution and monitoring in a manner informed by the carbon footprint of process designs and instances. This article describes the first steps in the development of this class of technologies.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509128,An Information Model for the Provisioning of Network Connections Enabling Customer-Specific End-to-End QoS Guarantees.,"The growing significance of international collaborations in research, education, and business fields has raised the demand for the assurance of the quality of the network connections which the projects and applications are realized upon. A large spectrum of examples with diverse requirements is found in areas such as GRID- and Cloud computing, eLearning, and video-conferencing. The consequences of these diverse project and application requirements culminate in the urgent necessity to provide an End-to-End (E2E) guarantee for any customer-specific or user-tailored combination of service-specific Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The quality of the overall network connections provided to users obviously directly depends on the quality of the involved connection parts. This means that already during the setup negotiation process the quality of the available connection parts has to be considered. Especially for international connections it is common that multiple independent service providers (SPs) realize different connection segments. This means in turn, that during the information exchange about available connection parts not only the technical challenges have to be solved, but also preferences and restrictions of the involved provider domains must be considered. In this paper we present a novel information model for the description of such connections. In the proposed model, a multi-domain view is derived from the single-domain perspectives of each considered SP. This model serves as a pro-found basis for an end-to-end routing algorithm which considers multiple user specific QoS parameters in parallel. The proposed model also accounts for the typically very restrictive SP information policies.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509129,Feedback Controlled Quality of Service Enforcement for Service Oriented Architectures.,"When using SOAs in mission critical environments, quality and performance related aspects may not be ignored. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) have to be defined and applied during runtime. In this paper we present a method to enhance an existing SOA container to take into account Quality of Service (QoS) related aspects and enforce these aspects during runtime using feedback controlled priority adaptations. Without major modifications existing business services can use this QoS-component. A use case of the Luxembourg National Benefits Fund shows the benefits of the proposed solution in an operational system.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509130,Utility Decomposition and Surplus Redistribution in Composite SLA Negotiation.,"The end-to-end QoS negotiation for SLA establishment for composite services involves compound multi-party negotiations in which the composite service provider concurrently negotiates with multiple candidates for each atomic service, selecting the ones that best satisfy the atomic service QoS preferences while ensuring that end-to-end QoS requirements are also fulfilled. In order to negotiate with potential candidates, it is necessary to derive the atomic utility boundaries from the global utility boundary. Additionally, there needs to be a mechanism to update these boundaries in subsequent negotiation rounds based upon the individual negotiation outcomes. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that addresses both these requirements and evaluate it using an example scenario for composite service provisioning.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509131,A Continuous Long Running Batch Orchestration Model for Workflow Instance Migration.,"Workflow engines which require process instances to run to completion against their creation model are limited in their ability to adapt to model changes. The technique of process instance migration can be used to migrate instances to a new process model, but at any given time only a fraction of instances may be in a state which is compatible with the new model. We propose a continuous batch approach for migration which treats migration itself as a long running problem. The continuous migration approach schedules and orchestrates the evaluation and migration of long running processes over time, controlled by configurable policies while maintaining continuous process availability. We have built a long running process migration simulation to test our approach, looking at both migration success and cost. The simulation confirms the need for a long running migration approach and yields some interesting suggestions for tuning the configuration of the migration system.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509132,Describing and Verifying Web Service Composition Using TLA Reasoning.,"Web service composition is the process of integrating multiple independent Web Services into a coherent system that performs complex functions. This paper proposes an effective method for performing Web service composition and verification. We use Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) to model Web services, composition patterns and usersâ€™ requests. Based on the models, composition can be created by conducting TLA reasoning. The correctness of composition result can also be verified by checking whether the resulted TLA formula implements a userâ€™s request. A case study was conducted to illustrate the correctness of our approach.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509133,Towards a Unified Service Description Language for the Internet of Services: Requirements and First Developments.,"Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web services leverage the technical value of solutions in the areas of distributed systems and cross-enterprise integration. The emergence of Internet marketplaces for business services is driving the need to describe services, not only from a technical level, but also from a business and operational perspective. While, SOA and Web services reside in an IT layer, organizations owing Internet marketplaces are requiring advertising and trading business services which reside in a business layer. As a result, the gap between business and IT needs to be closed. This paper presents USDL (Unified Service Description Language), a specification language to describe services from a business, operational and technical perspective. USDL plays a major role in the Internet of Services to describe tradable services which are advertised in electronic marketplaces. The language has been tested using two service marketplaces as use cases.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509134,SOAC: A Conceptual Model for Managing Service-Oriented Authorization.,"A web service can be composed of multiple component web services in a loosely-coupled environment. Traditional Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is inadequate for the authorization management of composite services since the administration of the component web services has not been taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a novel conceptual model, named as Service Oriented Authorization Control (SOAC) to facilitate the administration and management for both service consumers and component web services. A set of administrative functions are also provided for managing the elements of SOAC. This research will be the first step towards managing service-oriented authorization.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

This work presents the contact collector tool developed at IBM that allows the contact center supervisors to record and analyze the behavior of various agent customer handling processes. The contact collector tool generates quantifiable insights to improve operational strengths and productivity as well as to enhance the quality of the overall interaction. The present work also discusses the advantages of automating the contact collector tool, technical challenges encountered in the automation process so far and performance of the automated components of the tool.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509136,Prospective and Retrospective Provenance Collection in Scientific Workflow Environments.,"Provenance, a record of the derivation history of scientific results, is critical for scientific workflows to support reproducibility, result interpretation, and problem diagnosis. Both prospective provenance, which captures an abstract workflow specification as a recipe for future data derivation, and retrospective provenance, which captures past workflow execution and data derivation information, provide important contextual information for the comprehensive analysis of scientific results. In this paper, we explore and design: i) a provenance model that models both prospective and retrospective provenance as an extension to the Open Provenance Model (OPM), which only models retrospective provenance; ii) a provenance collection framework to collect both prospective and retrospective provenance according to our model; iii) a relational provenance store to store, reason, and query prospective and retrospective provenance, which is captured via the proposed provenance collection framework. An experimental study is performed to show the performance of our provenance store using provenance queries for the Third Provenance Challenge. While most existing systems use an internal proprietary provenance model and develop an import/export facility to convert between the proprietary model and OPM, our provenance collection framework and provenance store feature the native support of OPM.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509137,Xi-Calculus: A Calculus for Service Interactions.,"The paper proposes xi-calculus, a formalism for describing interactions in Service Oriented Architectures. The calculus treats interactions between services as a core concept to capture important architectural characteristics of the system. The focus of x-calculus is on the higher level abstraction rather than on the lower level details like parameter passing, use of stacks, closures etc. And hence it can be used to specify, study, and compare different service oriented systems from an architectural point of view. The paper also introduces a notion of interaction types suitable for the level of abstraction under consideration. These types are used to describe the type system of the calculus. The paper introduces a notion of {\em design time non-functional capabilities} and also present the application of the calculus in a real business scenario.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509138,A Heuristic Algorithm for Trust-Oriented Service Provider Selection in Complex Social Networks.,"In a service-oriented online social network consisting of service providers and consumers, a service consumer can search trustworthy service providers via the social network. This requires the evaluation of the trustworthiness of a service provider along a certain social trust path from the service consumer to the service provider. However, there are usually many social trust paths between participants in social networks. Thus, a challenging problem is which social trust path is the optimal one that can yield the most trustworthy evaluation result. In this paper, we first present a novel complex social network structure and a new concept, Quality of Trust (QoT). We then model the optimal social trust path selection with multiple end-to-end QoT constraints as a Multi-Constrained Optimal Path (MCOP) selection problem which is NP-Complete. For solving this challenging problem, we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm, H OSTP. The results of our experiments conducted on a large real dataset of online social networks illustrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing approaches.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509139,Measuring Compliance and Deviations in a Template-Based Service Contract Development Process.,"Asset-based approaches, involving the use of standardized reusable components (as opposed to building custom solutions), are increasingly being adopted by IT service industries to achieve higher standardization, quality and cost reduction goals. In this paper, we address issues related to the use of an asset-based approach for authoring service contracts, where standard templates are defined for each type of service offered. The success of such an approach relies on a compliance checking system. We focus on three key components of such a system. The first measures how well actual contracts comply with the standard templates. The second analyzes compliant contracts containing moderate deviations and reports on the consistent patterns of deviations observed for each template to help identify necessary modifications required in templates to keep them up-to-date with evolving business requirements and customer needs. The third analyzes noncompliant contracts and identifies groups within them such that members of each group have enough similarity to each other to warrant consideration for development of new templates for each group. We describe the architecture of the proposed system, our experience in the use of various text analysis techniques to prototype different system components, and the lessons learned.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509140,Process Trace Identification from Unstructured Execution Logs.,"Many real world business processes are executed without explicit orchestration and hence do not generate structured execution logs. This is particularly true for the class of business processes which are executed in service delivery centers in emerging markets where rapid changes in processes and in the people executing the processes are common. In such environments, the process execution logs are usually natural language descriptions of actions performed and hence are noisy. Despite the lack of structured logs, it is crucial to know the trace of activities as they happen on the ground. Without such a visibility into the ground activities, regulatory compliance audit, process optimization, and best practices standardization are severely disabled. Process monitoring on top of unstructured execution logs has been a relatively unexplored research area. This paper proposes an approach for process trace identification from unstructured logs that applies state-of-the-art text mining techniques. It applies this approach on logs of a real-world business process used in a service delivery center and shows that individual process activities are correctly identified 90% of the time. Also, 65% of the activity traces were identified with zero errors and an additional 24% with a single error. This approach is generic and applicable to a wide array of business processes.

1509141,Business-Driven Trust Federation Management for Service Marketplaces.,"In Web service ecosystems, business participants, such as service consumers, service providers and service marketplaces are required to form temporary collaborations to support virtual and dynamic business value networks. This requires participants in the collaboration to establish ondemand trust relationships (i.e. a trust federation) between each other and hence enable service sharing or consumption between partners in a secure and trustworthy way. This paper proposes a business-driven approach that can effectively manage the lifecycle of a trust federation according to business decisions taking place in service marketplaces. By leveraging a federation management architecture, we can establish, enforce, update, or dissolve trust relationships required by business collaborations on demand, which greatly reduces the costs for complicated and error-prone trust configurations in individual enterprise domains.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

1509143,BPEL Remote Objects: Integrating BPEL Processes into Object-Oriented Applications.,"Service-orientation and object-oriented design are common practice in the field of business application development. Business process execution languages help to facilitate the orchestration of Web services in service-oriented architectures (SOA). However, using business processes from within object-oriented and event-driven applications is difficult as asynchronous event handling is missing in workflow-based business process modeling languages. The present article presents an approach for integrating BPEL business processes into object-oriented applications. We propose BPEL remote objects (BPELROs) that can be accessed asynchronously in an object-oriented manner. We present a method how state-based business processes can be implemented using BPELROs. It is shown how to apply BPELROs for software modernization tasks and we also evaluate the performance of BPELROs on different BPEL engines.

1509144,Towards a Variability Model for SOA-Based Solutions.,"The prevalent approach to developing business solutions is driven by requirements expressed as process models. This is essentially a top-down model-driven development approach for building solutions from a given process model specification, from scratch. However, in order to enhance the reusability of such solutions, the emphasis has now shifted to defining business solutions via service-oriented architectures (SOAs) that compose software services to support business processes. This enables creating and reusing services and processes as software â€œassetsâ€ù which is more scalable and profitable. In this context, the key to reusing assets is to support the right mechanisms to incrementally refine existing software services as well as business processes. Our earlier works, viz., Variation Oriented Engineering (VOE) and Variation Oriented Service Design (VOSD), proposed some mechanisms in this direction. But our experiences in developing and inducting VOE and VOSD into IBMâ€™s business units motivated the need for a rigorous formal foundation for variability in SOA-based solutions. To that end, this paper proposes a Variability Model for SOA-based solutions, through which variations in a service can be modeled and maintained. Our Variability Model also clarifies the extent to which an existing service can be modified to suit a business process requirement, while ensuring that the overall integrity of the service is maintained. We also present an algorithm for determining whether a variant of a service is a legal variant, and we demonstrate our Variability Model on a realistic running example in the insurance domain, via a prototype built on IBMâ€™s Rational Software Architect modeling tool.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

It is able to support customerâ€™s business operations through a complex IT service chain, appraised by a Service Level Management (SLM) system. Due to the long term contractual relationship (10 years) with Italian Railways, TSF developed a symbiotic relationship with its main customer, becoming co-accountable for its business performance. This aspect has highlighted the necessity of the definition of an extended SLM model able to correlate the customer business performances with the delivered ICT service levels, in the perspective of an end-to-end service delivery chain.

However, the definition of complex pattern-detection logic may place heavy demands on business users. In this work we present a model for hierarchical event-patterns, allowing users to compose complex patterns from encapsulated, fully-abstracted sub-pattern definitions with a visual decision graph. Pattern definitions can be reused across business scenarios, thereby encouraging the creation of pattern libraries. In the course of this paper we give a brief overview of the event-based system SARI and describe a number of extensions to its ruling model. We present an algorithm for evaluating hierarchical ruling logic and demonstrate our approach with a use case from the fraud-detection domain.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509147,A Service-Oriented Framework for GNU Octave-Based Performance Prediction.,"Cloud/Grid environments are characterized by a diverse set of technologies used for communication, execution and management. Service Providers, in this context, need to be equipped with an automated process in order to optimize service provisioning through advanced performance prediction methods. Furthermore, existing software solutions such as GNU Octave offer a wide range of possibilities for implementing these methods. However, their automated use as services in the distributed computing paradigm includes a number of challenges from a design and implementation point of view. In this paper, a loosely coupled service-oriented implementation is presented, for taking advantage of software like Octave in the process of creating and using prediction models during the service lifecycle of a SOI. In this framework, every method is applied as an Octave script in a plug-in fashion. The design and implementation of the approach is validated through a case study application which involves the transcoding of raw video to MPEG4.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509148,Towards a Foundation for Quantitative Service Analysis.,"To bridge the gap between the high resolution digital images and limited display capability of mobile devices, this paper proposes a method to automatically transform static images to dynamic video clips to fit the requirement of mobile devices. Face detection and attention region detection techniques are applied to extract important regions that users may be interested in. Then a procedure of video resolution adaptation is performed for different screen size and aspect ratio. An algorithm to imitate camera motions is applied to visit the detected important regions to generate the motion effects. Finally the video clip is encoded with AVS-M standard as an implementation to be displayed on different mobile platforms. The solution provided in this paper can enable users viewing photographs in a dynamic mode using mobile devices that could not only glance over the whole picture of the image automatically, but also enjoy the important details of the photo. Furthermore, vivid dynamic effect enhances the viewing experience of users.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

1509150,Defining Metrics for Loose Coupling Evaluation in Service Composition.,"Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) mainly rely on the service composition mechanism which supports the reusability. Numerous researches focus on this thematic in order to satisfy all the objectives of quality fixed by the SOA community. One of these objectives is the notion of loose coupling between the composition's services. However this notion is intuitively understood and tangible, its definition lacks formalism. This unclear picture of the loose coupling is reflected in limited metrics which do not allow for its quantitative and objective evaluation. In this paper, we propose a set of different metrics which are associated with a clear definition of the loose coupling notion. These metrics act as guidelines for architects to develop their composite service. They are gathered in a formula which allows for evaluating the global coupling of a composition of services. Moreover, they are also used as comparison criteria for classifying existing composition models.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509151,A Business Centric End-to-End Monitoring Approach for Service Composites.,"Enterprise applications today are composed of multiple independently executing services and processes that collectively provide a solution to a business problem. These composite applications contain a heterogeneous collection of services that execute in a variety of runtimes making them difficult to manage while maintaining a business centric point of view, as opposed to a service point of view. This paper introduces a business centric monitoring framework to bridge the gap between the business and service levels in complex business applications. Our technical approach focuses on using business information invariants to define one or more monitor sets in order to relate service activity to business composite execution. We apply this framework to enable end-to-end monitoring of composite business applications. In this paper we present an initial prototype of our business centric monitoring approach using monitor sets for monitoring a simple loan application composite implemented on IBMâ€™s WebSphere Business Modeler, Process Server and Business Monitor. Our prototype implementation demonstrates the convenience, effectiveness and ease of design and deployment of our monitoring solution to attain a single end-to-end business centric view of a collection of heterogeneous services executing together. Our work also exposes potential challenges as we extend this work to support more powerful end-to-end monitoring.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,
1509152,Online Self-Reconfiguration with Performance Guarantee for Energy-Efficient Large-Scale Cloud Computing Data Centers.,"In a typical large-scale data center, a set of applications are hosted over virtual machines (VMs) running on a large number of physical machines (PMs). Such a virtualization technique can be used for conserving power consumption by minimizing the number of PMs that should be turned on according to the application requirements to resource. However, the resource demands for VMs is dynamic in nature since the number of user requests the applications should handle is rapidly changing in practice. It is a great challenge to online reconfigure the VMs (i.e., optimize the number and the locations for the VMs) according to the dynamic resource demands. Especially for the emerging applications of large-scale data centers for cloud computing systems, existing approaches either fails to find a best configuration of VMs or cannot produce a result in an acceptable time. In this paper, we propose an online self-reconfiguration approach for reallocating VMs in large-scale data centers. It first accurately predicts the future workloads of the applications with Brownâ€™s quadratic exponential smoothing. Based on such a prediction, it adopts a genetic algorithm to efficiently find the optimal reconfiguration policy. The resource utilization of large-scale cloud computing data centers can thus be improved and their energy consumption can be greatly conserved. We conduct extensive experiments and the results verify that our approach can effectively switch off more unnecessary running PMs comparing with current approaches without a performance degradation of the whole system.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

A case study is presented to illustrate how this visual model defines e-contracts and a preliminary evaluation of the model is also done.",2010,,,,,IEEE SCC,,,

1534448,From Representational State Transfer to Accountable State Transfer Architecture.,"Since Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture was proposed by Fielding in early 1990s for distributed hypermedia systems, it has become a popular architectural style of choice in various computing environments. However, REST was not originally designed to support enterprise requirements, in particular the accountability requirements that are crucial for the business services offered through the Software as a Service (SaaS) and Cloud Computing environments. In this paper, we propose an Accountable State Transfer (AST) architecture to bridge the accountability gap in REST. With AST, service participants can be held accountable for each representational state transfer during service consumption. A formal service contract model with a hybrid reasoning mechanism and a novel accountable state transfer protocol are designed as the mechanisms underpinning the AST architecture. Moreover, we implement a Credit Check service prototype based on AST, demonstrating the practicality of such architecture. Inheriting RESTâ€™s scalability, AST architecture provides the much needed accountability capabilities for the virtual service delivery environment.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

1534450,An Effective Heuristic for On-line Tenant Placement Problem in SaaS.,"As one of the key characteristics of Software as a Service (SaaS), multi-tenancy aims to support massive customers by sharing application instances and databases. To achieve the high economies of scale, one of the most issues needing to be solved in the real industry is that, given a fixed number of nodes, how to optimally place on-boarding tenants to maximize the total supported number of tenants without violating their SLA requirements. This paper focuses on this problem, which is called On-line Tenant Placement Problem (OTPP). In order to calculate the resource consumption of on-boarding tenants, a novel resource consumption estimation model for multi-tenant pattern is proposed in this paper. Based on this model, we explore the complexity of OTPP. A robust heuristic is proposed for the OTPP. The simulation experimental results show the high effectiveness and the good efficiency of our algorithm.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

1534453,Utility-Based Optimal Service Selection for Business Processes in Service Oriented Architectures.,"Service Oriented Architectures enable markets of functionally equivalent service providers delivering services at different Quality of Service (QoS) and cost levels. Under these circumstances, there is a need for mechanisms to optimally select service providers at run-time to support a business process execution so that a utility function for the business process is maximized subject to QoS and cost constraints. This is an NP-hard problem. This paper investigates this problem when the utility function is expressed in terms of multiple QoS metrics. An efficient optimal algorithm is presented, which eliminates the need to exhaustively search the state space. This algorithm can be used for small to medium size problems. A very efficient heuristic solution is also presented and scientifically evaluated against the optimal solution on a large set of randomly generated business processes.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534454,Confucius: A Scientific Collaboration System Using Collaborative Scientific Workflows.,"Large-scale scientific data management and analysis usually relies on many distributed scientists with diverse expertise. In recent years, such a collaborative effort is often composed and automated into a dataflow-oriented process, a so-called scientific workflow. However, existing scientific workflow tools are single user-oriented and do not support collaborative scientific workflow composition, execution, and management among multiple distributed scientists. In this paper, we report our study of collaboration protocols towards building a tool supporting collaborative scientific workflow composition. Based on a scientific collaboration ontology, we propose a collaboration model supported by a set of collaboration primitives and patterns. The collaboration protocols are then applied to support effective concurrency control in the process of collaborative workflow composition.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534455,Detecting Data Inconsistency Failure of Composite Web Services Through Parametric Stateful Aspect.,"Runtime monitoring of Web service compositions with WS-BPEL has been widely acknowledged as a significant approach to understand and guarantee the quality of services. However, most existing monitoring technologies only track patterns related to the execution of an individual process. As a result, the possible inconsistency failure caused by implicit interactions among concurrent process instances cannot be detected. To address this issue, this paper proposes an approach to specify the behavior properties related to shared resources for web service compositions and verify their consistency with the aid of a parametric stateful aspect extension to WS-BPEL. Parameters are introduced in pattern specification, which allows monitoring not only events but also their values bound to the parameters at runtime to keep track of data flow among concurrent process instances. An efficient implementation is also provided to reduce the runtime overhead of monitoring and event observation. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is promising.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534456,Extending BPMN for Supporting Customer-Facing Service Quality Requirements.,"Service-oriented computing promises to create flexible business processes and applications on demand by dynamically assembling loosely coupled services within and across organizations. Quality requirements play a central role in service sourcing and, together with Service Level Agreements, facilitate service selection and measurement of service delivery effectiveness. This empowers customers to make better decisions when faced with multiple service offerings and varying service costs. However, existing business process modeling languages provide little support for quality requirements annotation and specification. This paper argues that quality requirements are a central aspect of business process modeling specification, and thus proposes to incorporate time, cost and reliability quality requirements as extensions to the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). These quality requirements are evaluated based on analytical model using reduction rules. An example of online purchasing business process is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

1534458,A Collectional Data Model for Scientific Workflow Composition.,"Modern scientific computations are usually data intensive, involving large-scale, heterogeneous and structured scientific datasets. Modeling, organizing, and processing scientific data have become key challenges for scientific workflow management systems (SWFMSs). In contrast to business data, which is usually relational and stored in databases, scientific data is often hierarchically organized and collection oriented. Although several data models have been proposed for SWFMSs, none of them provides a formal data model with a set of well-defined operators. In this paper, we take a first step towards formalizing a collection-oriented data model, called collectional data model, to model hierarchical collection oriented scientific data, and a set of well-defined operators to manipulate and query such data. We then apply the collectional data model to VIEW, a dataflow-based scientific workflow composition framework, whose workflow constructs are extended to support collections. We implement our techniques and validate them by a case study in a biological simulation project.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

1534460,Two-Staged Approach for Semantically Annotating and Brokering TV-related Services.,"Nowadays, more and more distributed digital TV and TV-related resources are published on the Web, such as Electronic Personal TV Guide (EPG) data. To enable applications to access these resources easily, the TV resource data is commonly provided by Web service technologies. The huge variety of data related to the TV domain and the wide range of services that provide it, raises the need to have a broker to discover, select and orchestrate services to satisfy the runtime requirements of applications that invoke these services. The variety of data and heterogeneous nature of the service capabilities makes it a challenging domain for automated web-service discovery and composition. To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage service annotation approach, which is resolved by integrating Linked Services and IRS-III semantic web services framework, to complete the lifecycle of service annotating, publishing, deploying, discovering, orchestration and dynamic invocation. This approach satisfies both developerâ€™s and applicationâ€™s requirements to use Semantic Web Services (SWS) technologies manually and automatically.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534461,Mashing-Up Rich User Interfaces for Human-Interaction in WS-BPEL.,"Services computing paradigm together with Web services have significantly promoted the automation of business process in enterprise. Prevalent service composition technologies, such as WS-BPEL and WSCI, provide promising means to deal with machine-to-machine communication. Traditionally, in the phase of business process modeling, there usually require some human-involved tasks. Recent new technologies such as BPEL4People and Human Task begin to consider involving human interaction in business process. However, such approaches still have some limitations. On one hand, they exactly require some extensions of current BPEL standards. As a result, the existing business processes have to be rewritten and redeployed. On the other hand, they yet lack of the development and deployment supports of flexible and reusable user interfaces in business process. In this paper, we address these issues by enabling human interaction in business process with rich web applications. Our approach models human tasks as services, and can be seamlessly integrated to current BPEL without any modifications to existing engine and processes. We further support building human task presentations from service-oriented rich user interfaces. During the process execution, the corresponding task stakeholders can select, configure and compose these reusable and rich UI components according to their own application context.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534462,Apto: A MDD-Based Generic Framework for Context-Aware Deeply Adaptive Service-Based Processes.,"Context-awareness and adaptability are important and desirable properties of service-based processes designed to provide personalized services. Most of the existing approaches focus on the adaptation at the process instance level [1] which involves extending the standard Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) and its engine or creating their own process languages (e.g. [2]). However, the approach proposed here aims to apply an adaptation to processes modeled or developed without any adaptation possibility in mind and independently of specific usage contexts. In addition, most of the existing approaches tackle the adaptation on the process instance or definition levels by explicitly specifying some form of variation points. This, however, leads to a contradiction between how the architect logically views and interprets differences in the process family and the actual modeling constructs through which the logical differences must be expressed. We introduce the notion of an evolution fragment and evolution primitive to capture the variability in a more logical and independent way. Finally, the proposed approach intends to support the viewpoint of context-aware adaptation as a crosscutting concern with respect to the core â€œbusiness logicâ€ù of the process. In this way, the design of the process core can be decoupled from the design of the adaptation logic. To this end, we leverage ideas from the domain of model-driven development (MDD) and generative programming.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534463,RegionKNN: A Scalable Hybrid Collaborative Filtering Algorithm for Personalized Web Service Recommendation.,"Several approaches to web service selection and recommendation via collaborative filtering have been studied, but seldom have these studies considered the difference between web service recommendation and product recommendation used in e-commerce sites. In this paper, we present RegionKNN, a novel hybrid collaborative filtering algorithm that is designed for large scale web service recommendation. Different from other approaches, this method employs the characteristics of QoS by building an efficient region model. Based on this model, web service recommendations will be generated quickly by using modified memory-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that apart from being highly scalable, RegionKNN provides considerable improvement on the recommendation accuracy by comparing with other well-known collaborative filtering algorithms.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534464,A Feature-Oriented Approach for Web Service Customization.,"This paper proposes a feature-oriented approach for Web services customization that can address three key challenges: reducing complexity, automated validation and dynamic deployment. We exploit techniques from Software Product Line (SPL) domain, particularly feature modeling techniques, to design our framework. Feature modeling allows to abstract variability in consumersâ€™ requirements to simplify customization processes, while automated analysis on feature models helps to validate customizations. The use of feature models at runtime enables dynamic deployment of a business process as a result of a service customization. We propose the use of feature models as service description artifacts to facilitate service customizations. The framework builds on a Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach to automate large parts of its operation.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534465,On Service Community Learning: A Co-clustering Approach.,"Efficient and accurate discovery of user desired Web services is a key component for achieving the full potential of service computing. However, service discovery is a non-trivial task considering the large and fast growing service space. Meanwhile, Web services are typically autonomous and a priori unknown. This further complicates the service discovery problem. We propose a service community learning algorithm that can generate homogeneous communities from the heterogeneous service space. This can greatly facilitate the service discovery process as the users only need to search within their desired service communities. A key ingredient of the community learning algorithm is a co-clustering scheme that leverages the duality relationship between services and operations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real Web services demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed service community learning algorithm.

The design includes a monitoring component that utilizes a choreography model to formulate a global view of the application, and introduce adaptive behavior in a unique way. The design incorporates a mechanism for transforming the choreography to introduce redundancy, and dynamic selection in the interaction.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

However for this model, catering large number of publishers and subscribers while retaining acceptable performance is still a challenge. Therefore, this paper presents two parallelization strategies to improve message delivery of such systems. Furthermore, we discuss other techniques which can be adopted to increase the performance of the middleware. Finally, we conclude with an empirical study, which establishes the comparative merit of those two parallelization strategies in contrast to serial implementations.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534469,Highly Scalable Web Service Composition Using Binary Tree-Based Parallelization.,"Data intensive applications, e.g. in life sciences, pose new efficiency challenges to the service composition problem. Since today computing power is mainly increased by multiplication of CPU cores, algorithms have to be redesigned to benefit from this evolution. In this paper we present a framework for parallelizing service composition algorithms investigating how to partition the composition problem into multiple parallel threads. But in contrast to intuition, the straightforward parallelization techniques do not lead to superior performance as our baseline evaluation reveals. To harness the full power of multicore architectures, we propose two novel approaches to evenly distribute the workload in a sophisticated fashion. In fact, our extensive experiments on practical life science data resulted in an impressive speedup of over 300% using only 4 cores. Moreover, we show that our techniques can also benefit from all advanced pruning heuristics used in sequential algorithms.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

To ensure interoperability of the services, behavioral mismatches between their protocols need to be resolved in a fast and efficient way, which can be done with protocol adaptors. We present an efficient, automated method to construct (if possible) a minimal protocol adaptor with parallelism for two asynchronously communicating business protocols. A minimal adaptor only processes those messages that cause the mismatch, and has less message overhead at run-time than a non-minimal adaptor. Existing methods only build adaptors that are sequential, synchronous, or non-minimal. We show that the proposed method increases the efficiency of service adaption both at run-time and design-time.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534471,EDS: An Elastic Data-Service for Situational Applications.,"Developers of situational applications â€“ applications created by a small group of users/developers to satisfy the specific needs of the group â€“ require two things from their software stack. First, they require support for their rapidly changing designs; second, they require semantics that are close to their own domain of expertise. For example, developers of situational applications prefer to use scripting languages because the ""duck typing"" style of programming language allows them to ignore issues related to class inheritance or interface implementation. In comparison to strongly-typed languages, developers can begin programming more quickly, and can modify their program more rapidly in response to changing requirements. In this paper we explore whether middleware services can similarly provide developers of situational applications with these desired software characteristics. Specifically, we present EDS, an Extensible Data-Service designed to support applications whose design changes rapidly and with semantics that are closer to the domain expertise of situational application developers. We present the features of EDS, contrast it to other data services and APIs, and discuss the EDS implementation.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534472,A Uniform Device Information Access for Context-Aware Middleware.,"This paper presents a middleware for building context-aware applications. One of the main components, Device Information Access (DIA), is discussed in detail. Since many kinds of devices (e.g., RFID, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.) can be used to collect the context information, the middleware defines the Device Information Access component to communicate with different devices. A set of interfaces are devised in DIA, and the common functions such as getting and setting a data element are defined in the interfaces. For each device, we shall provide an implementation of the interfaces to communicate with the corresponding servers or software agents. DIA can communicate with the software agents or servers using various protocols such as RMI, Web Services, and REST. In this way the access to the hardware are encapsulated by the middleware and virtualized to the end-point applications. The architecture of the middleware and the functions of DIA are discussed, and an empirical application is also developed to validate our design.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

We first present a one pass algorithm based on the observation that a multi-service skyline is completely determined by single service skylines. The skyline is returned after an enumeration on a significantly reduced candidate space. We then develop a dual progressive algorithm that is able to progressively report the skyline. We conduct an experimental study to assess the performance of the skyline computation approaches. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

Incorporating mobile agents bring undeniable benefits to a distributed application. Present mobile agent technology fails to leverage the interoperable web infrastructure developed in a standard compliant manner.

In this paper we present the design and implementation of a service broker that supports the QoS-driven runtime adaptation of SOA applications offered as composite services to users. We describe the functionalities provided by the broker components and present their design and implementation according to two different versions we have developed and that are both based on open source products. The components of the first version have been developed in Java as Web services, while the second version takes advantage of OpenESB. Since the broker needs to sustain a traffic of requests generated by several concurrent users, we also present the replicated architectures of the two broker versions. We discuss the design tradeoffs and the lesson we have learned in developing the broker.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534476,DISCE: A Declarative Inter-ESB Service-Connectivity Configuration Engine.,"The service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been successfully applied in enterprise environments. Due to decentralized set-ups, mergers and acquisitions and organizational boundaries, many enterprises today operate multiple, fragmented and heterogeneous service infrastructures that are administered by different organizational units. This fragmented infrastructure causes service duplication and unnecessary redundancy. This paper proposes an approach of cross-domain service integration through an automated federation of Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs). ESBs are the mediation centers within a service domain that enable service interaction across technological boundaries by using service proxies. We present DISCE, a configuration engine prototype that enables an operator to configure service connectivity in such an environment in a declarative form, by specifying simple rules. The engine produces a configuration consisting of a set of proxies interconnecting clients and services.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534477,Enhancing Scalability and Performance of Mashups Through Merging and Operator Reordering.,"Recently, mashups are gaining tremendous popularity as an important Web 2.0 application. Mashups provide end-users with an opportunity to create personalized Web services which aggregate and manipulate data from multiple diverse sources distributed across the Web. However, this increase in personalization also results in new scalability and performance challenges. Surprisingly, there are very few studies on the performance aspect of mashups. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques to enhance the scalability and performance of mashup platforms. The first is an efficient mashup merging scheme that avoids duplicate computations and unnecessary data retrievals by detecting common operator sequences in different mashups and executing them together. Second, we propose a canonical form-based mashup reordering scheme that not only transforms individual mashups to their most efficient forms but also increases the effectiveness of mashup merging. This paper also reports a number of experiments studying the benefits and costs of the proposed techniques.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534478,HyperService: Linking and Exploring Services on the Web.,"Web is becoming a programmable platform, with countless services blooming everyday in various forms like Feeds, REST APIs and Widgets, etc. Although the existing technologies, such as Mashups, have reduced the challenges to build new applications by composing these services, it's still far from enabling the non-technical users to solve their situational problems by correlating and consuming these services. In this paper, we present our HyperService technology, which empowers a much more flexible way to link and explore existing services for solving various situational problems. In HyperService, the service metadata, service linkages and user behaviors are indexed and managed; Based on the userâ€™s input keywords and navigation context, a group of relevant services are dynamically searched, ranked and recommended for facilitating future navigations; the service navigation is smoothed by a web2.0 style exploratory user interface.

Two interface processes should be compatible when they can work properly. Our idea to fix incompatibility problem in service processes is to change an incompatible process so that the new process can simulate a compatible process. We consider not only the control flow but also the data flow in modeling the processes into FSMs. We present a technique that not only detects the incompatibility, but also provides resolution strategies to generate the new process.

1534480,Enabling Publish/Subscribe with COTS Web Services across Heterogeneous Networks.,"In scenarios such as search-and-rescue operations, it may be required to transmit information across multiple, heterogeneous networks, often experiencing unreliable connections and limited bandwidths. Under such conditions, Publish/subscribe-based communication, combined with store-and-forward capabilities in the network nodes, greatly improves the ability to transmit information. At the same time, it is desirable to use commercial, standards-based software as much as possible, in order to reduce both cost and development time, and to ease the interconnection of systems from different organizations. In this paper, we present our prototype middleware solution called the Delay and Disruption Tolerant SOAP Proxy (DSProxy) which adds Publish/Subscribe functionality to standard, unmodified Web services. Together with its ability to make Web services delay and disruption tolerant, the DSProxy enables SOA based on Web services in scenarios as described above. The DSProxy has been tested in field trials, with promising results.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534481,An Approach for Context-Aware Service Discovery and Recommendation.,"Given the large amount of existing services and the diversified needs nowadays, it is time-consuming for end-users to find appropriate services. To help end-users obtain their desired services, context-aware systems provide a promising way to automatically search and recommend services using a userâ€™s context. However, existing context-aware techniques have limited support for dynamic adaption to newly added context types (e.g., location, time and activity). Due to the diversity of userâ€™s environment, the available context types may change over time. It is challenging to anticipate a complete set of context types while we design a context aware system. In this paper, we propose a context modeling approach which can dynamically handle various context types and values. More specifically, we use ontologies to enhance the meaning of a userâ€™s context values and automatically indentify the relations among different context values. Based on the relations among context values, we capture the potential services which the user might need. A case study is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our approach can use contexts to find usersâ€™ needs and recommend their desired services with high precision and recall.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534482,Decentralized Approach for Execution of Composite Web Services Using the Chemical Paradigm.,"Nowadays, executions of composite Web services are typically conducted by heavyweight centralized engines. A centralized is a potential processing and communication bottleneck as well as a central point of failure, and its cost of deployment is usually too high for a large number of small businesses or end-users. In addition, it presents some weaknesses dealing with privacy issues. These drawbacks, and requirements such as loose coupling, are pushing service infrastructures toward more decentralized and dynamic interaction schemes. In this paper, we propose a decentralized alternative system for the execution of composite Web services based on the chemical analogy. The chemical paradigm provides a high-level execution model that allows executing composite services in a fully decentralized manner. Our architecture is composed by nodes communicating through a shared space containing both control and data flows, allowing to distribute the composition among nodes without the need for any centralized coordination.

There is an increasing interest on its application to real-time communication web services. Based on a case study of CSTA services, we found that communication services exhibit a combination of complex message exchange and stateful behavior patterns, including multi-states, two-way interaction, event-driven, multi-resources, multi-responses and session management, that need to be modeled properly within the framework of REST. To address these challenges, we propose three REST design patterns: session, event subscription and relationship using REST composition. This approach leads to a systematic one-to-one transformation from CSTA to REST. We hope such a study on a concrete use case can contribute to a better understanding of REST and lead to a seamless convergence of communication services with the infrastructure of the Web.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534485,Formal Specification and Verification of Data-Centric Service Composition.,Service-oriented architecture (SOA) promotes a paradigm where ad-hoc applications are built by dynamically linking service-based software capabilities. Service providers follow specification standards to advertise their servicesâ€™ capabilities and to enable loosely coupled integration between their services and other businesses over the Web. A major challenge in this domain is interpreting the data that must be marshaled between consumer and producer systems. We propose a framework to support formal modeling and contracts for data-centric Web services. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to verify correctness properties for composition of services.,2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

However, research shows that the effectiveness of most of those tools is very low and that using the wrong tool may lead to the deployment of services with undetected vulnerabilities. In this paper we propose a benchmarking approach to assess and compare the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools in web services environments. This approach was used to define a concrete benchmark for SQL Injection vulnerability detection tools. This benchmark is demonstrated by a real example of benchmarking several widely used tools, including four penetration-testers, three static code analyzers, and one anomaly detector. Results show that the benchmark accurately portrays the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools and suggest that the proposed approach can be applied in the field.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534487,DISC: A Declarative Framework for Self-Healing Web Services Composition.,"Web services composition design, verification and monitoring are active and widely studied research directions. Little work however has been done in integrating these related dimensions using a unified formalism. In this paper we propose a declarative event-oriented framework, called DISC, that serves as a unified framework to bridge the gap between the process design, verification and monitoring. Proposed framework allows for a composition design to accommodate various aspects such as data relationships and constraints, Web services dynamic binding, compliance regulations, security or temporal requirements and others. Then, it allows for instantiating, verifying and executing the composition design and for monitoring the process while in execution. The effect of run-time violations can also be calculated and a set of recovery actions can be taken, allowing for the self-healing Web services composition.

1534488,SOA4All: An Innovative Integrated Approach to Services Composition.,"Automated web service composition has been tackled from different directions and to different purposes. In addition, most of the approaches address the composition problem with under specified requirements, returning compositions models that do not necessarily satisfy and fulfill end-users objectives. Satisfying the latter objectives is a difficult problem, especially from scratch, which requires stronger requirements and a further step of integration with service-based components in order to make service oriented computing and service composition a reality. In this work, we address this issue by presenting an innovative and integrated approach to service composition which consists of i) an automatic template process generator, that is able to generate abstract process templates and their hierarchy from past executions; ii) a novel and scalable approach to AI parametric-design techniques using a multi agent approach to configure and adapt services processes, heavily relying on the latter set of abstract process templates; iii) an optimization process that maximizes the overall quality of final compositions. Finally, we compare the scalability of these components with some experiments.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

However advertised quality of service (QoS) alone cannot paint the true picture of how the service has performed so far and how it will continue to function in the near future. This information is crucial for service selection.

The approach allows matching of requirements and capabilities based not only on the syntactical representation of their corresponding assertions but also on their semantic meaning. Besides vocabulary mismatches our approach can also handle granularity mismatches, e.g. if two capabilities in combination satisfy a single requirement. We present a validation of our approach consisting of a performance evaluation and the realization of a use case, both based on our implementation of the semantic policy matching algorithm. We furthermore show the advantages of our approach compared to existing related work. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

1534491,Towards Data-Aware QoS-driven Adaptation for Service Orchestrations.,"Several activities in service oriented computing can benefit from knowing properties of a given service composition ahead of time. We will focus here on properties related to computational cost and resource usage, in a wide sense, as they can be linked to QoS characteristics. In order to attain more accuracy, we formulate computational cost / resource usage as functions on input data (or appropriate abstractions thereof) and show how these functions can be used to make more informed decisions when performing composition, proactive adaptation, and predictive monitoring. We present an approach to, on one hand, automatically synthesize these functions from orchestrations and, on the other hand, to effectively use them to increase the quality of non-trivial service-based systems with data-dependent behavior. We validate our approach by means of simulations with runtime selection of services and adaptation due to service failure.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534492,Timed Extended Invariants for the Passive Testing of Web Services.,"The service-oriented approach is becoming more and more popular to integrate highly heterogeneous systems. Web services are the natural evolution of conventional middleware technologies to support Web-based and enterprise level integration. Formal testing of such Web-based technology is a key point to guarantee its reliability. In this paper, we choose a non-intrusive approach based on monitoring to propose a conformance passive testing methodology to check that a composed Web service respects its functional requirements. This methodology is based on a set of formal invariants representing properties to be tested including data and time constraints. Passive testing of an industrial system (that uses a composition of Web services) is briefly presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534493,Implementing Attribute-Based Encryption in Web Services.,"Web services are now widely used in web-based applications. To protect the information in web services, many security specifications have been proposed. Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) provides us a brand new cryptographic primitive for access control. This paper sets out to examine an unexplored area to date â€“ how attribute-based encryption might be used to provide privacy and security for web services. We try to implement ABE in web services. The implementation and performance evaluation demonstrate that ABE is efficient and feasible in web services.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534494,Context Model Based SOA Policy Framework.,"With the popularity of SOA, SOA policy becomes one of the core technical enablers for SOA governance and management. Different in several aspects from traditional policy for distributed system management, policy applied in SOA solutions needs to take into account various policy types and enforcement points in different layers of SOA solution stack and different phases of SOA lifecycle. As well, it has the unique requirements on compliance to match existing SOA technologies and characteristics, as simplicity, standardization, high performance, etc. In this paper, a novel context model based SOA policy management framework by innovatively extending W3C Service Modeling Language (SML) and ISO Schematron is introduced. Firstly, a common context model distilled from SOA policy types typically including service policy, service governance policy, application policy and business policy, is presented. Then, the core components - context model based policy engine and definition tool are described. Finally, it is illustrated how the unified definition tools and policy engine are manipulated within the context model based SOA policy framework to manage and enforce policies in typical scenarios as service meta-data management, service match making and business process management. Based on the project, we participated in the works for defining W3C SML V1.1 working draft and proposed the works introduced in this paper to W3C SML Working Group. This paper demonstrates how these technologies and architectures significantly enhance the capability of SOA governance and management throughout whole SOA lifecycle and spanning the layers of SOA solution stack.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534495,Semantic Support for Adaptive Long Term Composed Services.,"We propose an integrated framework that manages changes in long term composed services. The main procedure of change reaction is presented. One of the most challenging research issues of change management is how to automate the process of change reaction. To address this issue, we propose a semantic support, which centers around a tree-structured Web service ontology. The ontology is expected to provide sufficient semantic for change reaction. We propose a set of algorithms for efficiently querying semantics from the ontology. We conduct a set of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534496,From Specification to Adaptation: An Integrated QoS-driven Approach for Dynamic Adaptation of Web Service Compositions.,"Web services composition environment is highly dynamic with new services being deployed, existing ones becoming unavailable or their QoS and other non-functional properties (cost, availability, etc.) changing dynamically. However, current approaches for web services composition and execution, such as WS-BPEL, can neither tailor the execution automatically as per the required QoS nor can they adapt to the highly dynamic environment. Though there have been some recent efforts in this direction they are piecemeal and insufficient. They either do not take user's non-functional requirements (NFRs) into consideration for adaptation, or there is no standard way of specifying these requirements for a BPEL process. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach for dynamically adapting web service compositions based on NFRs. We first give a specification for representing NFRs for each partner service of a BPEL process, and then describe a system that dynamically adapts the BPEL process based on these requirements by selecting suitable services at runtime. The selected services only need to be semantically equivalent and the system automatically takes care of the syntactical differences between their interfaces. We integrated our system in an existing BPEL engine using aspect oriented approach and demonstrate via experiments that it has very little performance overhead even at high loads.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534497,Adaptive Goals for Self-Adaptive Service Compositions.,"Service compositions need to continuously self- adapt to cope with unexpected failures. In this context adaptation becomes a fundamental requirement that must be elicited along with the other functional and non functional requirements. Beside modelling, effective adaptation also demands means to trigger it at runtime as soon as the actual behavior of the composition deviates from stated requirements. This paper extends traditional goal models with adaptive goals to support continuous adaptation. Goals become live, runtime entities whose satisfaction level is dynamically updated. Furthermore, boundary infringement triggers adaptation capabilities. The paper also provides a methodology to trace goals onto the underlying composition, assess goals satisfaction at runtime, and activate adaptation consequently. All the key elements are demonstrated on the definition of the process to control an advanced washing machine.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534498,Document Based Modeling of Web Services Choreographies Using Active XML.,This paper proposes a document based framework for the modeling of web-based choreographies involving a tight combination of workflow and data management. Our starting point is Active XML proposed by S. Abiteboul â€” AXML documents are XML documents with embedded service calls. We enhance Active XML with a rich notion of interface and we propose an effective technique to decide if provided services and needs of callers (defined as interfaces) are compatible. We also explicitly take distribution into account and allow for the composition of distributed AXML systems.,2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534499,QoS-based Late-Binding of Service Invocations in Adaptive Business Processes.,"Computing has reached the time of distributed applications everywhere. Service-oriented architectures are more and more used to organize such complex and highly dynamic applications into business processes calling services discovered in registries at load-time. In this context, Quality of Service (QoS) and agility in business processes become key issues. Instead of binding business processes to services at load-time, this paper proposes to monitor sets of candidate services for their current QoS and to choose among them at call-time. This new form of late-binding paves the way to more agile and robust applications called adaptive business processes. Besides the conceptual background and implementation of this late-binding in an industrial-strength web service platform, this paper presents the LCP-net formalism introduced to provide programmers with a mean to express qualitatively their preferences among the different QoS properties of services, hence tackling the multi-criteria decision making arising from the run-time choice among candidate services given several unrelated QoS properties.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534500,A Hybrid Scheme for Controlling Transactional Composite Services.,"This paper proposes a hybrid concurrency control scheme for transactional composite services. The scheme uses the information gathered from the workflow specifications of the composite services to reduce the overhead in detecting cycles in the serialization graph. The scheme carries out runtime analysis of the SQL statements used by the composite services to determine whether the clients that execute composite services depend on each other more accurately. As a result, it reduces the response time to some users. The proposed scheme also tackles the repeated rollback problem facing many concurrency control schemes.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534501,A Web 2.0-Based Scientific Application Framework.,"A significant obstacle to building usable, web-based interfaces for computational science in a Grid environment is how to deploy scientific applications on computational resources and expose these applications as web services. To streamline the development of these interfaces, we propose a new application framework that can deliver user-defined scientific workflows as both web services and OpenSocial gadgets. Through this application framework, scientists can focus on defining computational workflows using domain-specific applications and can use the software tools in the framework to quickly generate gadgets for running the applications and visualizing the output from workflow executions. By assembling these domain-specific gadgets and some common gadgets predefined in the framework for workflow management, scientists can easily set up a customized computational workspace to meet their requirements.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534502,Policy-Driven Service Composition with Information Flow Control.,"Ensuring secure information flow is a critical task for service composition in multi-domain systems. Research in security-aware service composition provides some preliminary solutions to this problem, but there are still issues to be addressed. In this paper, we develop a service composition mechanism specifically focusing on the secure information flow control issues. We first introduce a general model for information flow control in service chains, considering the transformation factors of services and security classes of data resources in a service chain. Then, we develop general rules to guide service composition satisfying secure information flow requirements. Finally, to achieve efficient service composition, we develop a three-phase protocol to allow rapid filtering of candidate compositions that are unlikely to satisfy the information flow constraints and thorough evaluation of highly promising candidates. Our approach can achieve effective and efficient service composition considering secure information flow. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

1534503,Script-Based Generation of Dynamic Testbeds for SOA.,"This paper addresses one of the major problems of SOA software development: the lack of support for testing complex service-oriented systems. The research community has developed various means for checking individual Web services but has not come up with satisfactory solutions for testing systems that operate in service-based environments and, therefore, need realistic testbeds for evaluating their quality. We regard this as an unnecessary burden for SOA engineers. As a proposed solution for this issue, we present the Genesis2 testbed generator framework. Genesis2 supports engineers in modeling testbeds and programming their behavior. Out of these models it generates running instances of Web services, clients, registries, and other entities in order to emulate realistic SOA environments. By generating real testbeds, our approach assists engineers in performing runtime tests of their systems and particular focus has been put on the frameworkâ€™s extensibility to allow the emulation of arbitrarily complex environments. Furthermore, by exploiting the advantages of the Groovy language, Genesis2 provides an intuitive yet powerful scripting interface for testbed control.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534504,Measuring Similarity of Web Services Based on WSDL.,"Web service has already been an important paradigm for web applications. Growing number of services need efficiently locating the desired web services. The similarity metric of web services plays important role in service search and classification. The very small text fragments in WSDL of web services are unsuitable for applying the traditional IR techniques. We describe our approach which supports the similarity search and classification of service operations. The approach firstly employs the external knowledge to compute the semantic distance of terms from two compared services. The similarity of services is measured upon these distances. Previous researches treat terms within the same WSDL documents as the isolated words and neglect the semantic association among them, hence lower down the accuracy of the similarity metric. We provide our method which tries to reflect the underlying semantics of web services by utilizing the terms within WSDL fully. The experiments show that our method works well on both service classification and query.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534505,Taking Advantage of Service Selection: A Study on the Testing of Location-Based Web Services Through Test Case Prioritization.,"Dynamic service compositions pose new verification and validation challenges such as uncertainty in service membership. Moreover, applying an entire test suite to loosely coupled services one after another in the same composition can be too rigid and restrictive. In this paper, we investigate the impact of service selection on service-centric testing techniques. Specifically, we propose to incorporate service selection in executing a test suite and develop a suite of metrics and test case prioritization techniques for the testing of location-aware services. A case study shows that a test case prioritization technique that incorporates service selection can outperform their traditional counterpart â€” the impact of service selection is noticeable on software engineering techniques in general and on test case prioritization techniques in particular. Further-more, we find that points-of-interest-aware techniques can be significantly more effective than input-guided techniques in terms of the number of invocations required to expose the first failure of a service composition.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534506,A MVC Framework for Policy-Based Adaptation of Workflow Processes: A Case Study on Confidentiality.,"Most work on adaptive workflows offers insufficient flexibility to enforce complex policies regarding dynamic, evolvable and robust workflows. In addition, many proposed approaches require customized workflow engines. This paper presents a portable framework for realistic enforcement of dynamic adaptation policies in business processes. The framework is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, commonly used for adding dynamism to web pages. To enhance reusability, our approach supports separation of adaptation logic from the functional workflow and modularization of workflow tasks in reusable aspects. The main idea is to design a workflow process as a template, where tasks can be specified on an abstract level. Concrete implementations of the tasks, modeled as aspects, are then selected from a library according to a policy-based adaptation logic. This logic is implemented using a general purpose language that offers an extensible and flexible solution to enforce any type of policy. We evaluate by means of a case study on workflow confidentiality to what extent an approach using standards-based technologies allows application-specific adaptation of running workflow instances.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534507,Clustering WSDL Documents to Bootstrap the Discovery of Web Services.,"The increasing use of the Web for everyday tasks is making Web services an essential part of the Internet customer's daily life. Users query the Internet for a required Web service and get back a set of Web services that may or may not satisfy their request. To get the most relevant Web services that fulfill the user's request, the user has to construct the request using the keywords that best describe the user's objective and match correctly with the Web Service name or location. Clustering Web services based on function similarities would greatly boost the ability of Web services search engines to retrieve the most relevant Web services. This paper proposes a novel technique to mine Web Service Description Language (WSDL) documents and cluster them into functionally similar Web service groups. The application of our approach to real Web services description files has shown good performance for clustering Web services based on function similarity, as a predecessor step to retrieving the relevant Web services for a user request by search engines.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534508,A Framework for Delivering Rigorously Trusted Services.,"Rigorously trusted services depend on reliable evidences to describe and check service behaviors. In this paper, we propose the pi-SOA framework, which delivers mutually trusted services in a rigorous way. The framework allows clients to verify service behaviors remotely according to their trust policies and uniquely identify the verified service at all times during its executions. On the other hand, service providers in this framework can check that clients have agreed with the service behaviors before using the service.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534509,Checking Compatibility and Replaceability in Web Services Business Protocols with Access Control.,"Recently, most enterprises adapt Web services technologies for designing and building complex inter-enterprise business applications. These applications are built by the coordination between set of Web services. Therefore, checking the compatibility between two services to guarantee that they can interact correctly is an important issue. In case of service update or replacement, there is a need for checking the replaceability to ensure that the new service is compatible with all the services which were compatible with the replaced one. These two type of checking are based on the services descriptions. Enriching services descriptions by including their behaviours is becoming more and more important. This behaviour can be described by business protocols representing the possible sequences of message exchanges. Since a lot of Web services use access control policies to restrict the access to authorized consumers, these policies should be a part of the service description. Checking compatibility and replaceability between Web services by analyzing their business protocols after assigning the access control policies is the main contribution of this work. Access control policies will be presented using ontology. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

1534510,Agile Service Oriented Architecture with Adaptive Processes Using Semantically Annotated Workflow Templates.,Although WS-BPEL is a widely used language for modeling executable business processes in service oriented architectures it is almost impossible to dynamically bind services at runtime taking complex constraints and optimisation goals into account. The approach presented in this paper uses semantically annotated workflow templates and extensions to introduce adaptability which enables agile service oriented architectures. The technological solution will be validated in a critical infrastructure environment where resilience and security play an important role.,2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534511,Evaluating the Survivability of SOA Systems Based on HMM.,"Survivability is crucial for computer systems that support critical infrastructures of our society. For those in paradigm of SOA where the computing settings are intrinsically open, traditional survivability model and safeguard mechanisms are no longer applicable. To rise to the challenge, we propose a formal definition and a corresponding framework to evaluate the survivability of SOA systems. We treat survivability as a multidimensional QoS property, and then give a holistic evaluation method based on the Hidden Markov Model.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534512,A Fuzzy Trust Management Framework for Service Web.,"We propose a fuzzy trust management framework for the Service Web. The proposed framework supports a natural way of representing and querying consumersâ€™ perception on services.

1534513,A Distributed Planning Approach for Web Services Composition.,"The ability to automatically answer a request that requires the composition of a set of web services has received much interest in the last decade, as it supports B2B applications. Planning techniques are used widely in the literature to describe the web services composition problem but they donâ€™t scale up well. This weakness is due to the search space explosion caused by the large ranges of data exchanged among services. In addition, it is more interesting to use a decentralised planner because the nature of the problem is distributed. In this paper, we consider a set of web service agents where each agent has a set of services organised in a graph. To respond to a request, agents propose their best local partial plans which are partial paths in the graph. They then coordinate their partial plans to provide the global plan for the submitted request using an algorithm based on a distributed heuristic function. This function ensures the optimality and the completeness of the algorithm. Indeed, it is based not only on the agent capabilities to respond to a request, but also taking into account the plans proposed by other agents. The complexity of the algorithm is polynomial. The experiments show the ability of our approach to find the optimal solutions for automated web services composition taking into account the dependencies betwen the agents.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534514,Service Selection Based on Customer Rating of Quality of Service Attributes.,"Selecting the optimal service from a set of functionally equivalent services is non-trivial. Previous research has addressed this issue making use of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes of the candidate services. In doing this, researchers have however assumed that the customers' preference of the various QoS attributes varies linearly with the actual attribute values. In this work, we put forward a technique that overcomes this restriction and compares functionally equivalent services on the basis of the customers' perception of the QoS attributes rather than the actual attribute values. We utilize the `mid-level splitting' method to track the customer's preference vis-a-vis the actual attribute values. Further, we utilize the `Hypothetical Equivalents and In equivalents Method' to assign weights, reflecting the importance, to the attributes on the basis of the customer preference. The whole procedure is demonstrated using a simple running example. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright Â© 2010 ACM, Inc.

1534515,Automated Runtime Verification for Web Services.,"This paper presents a methodology to perform passive testing of behavioural conformance for the web services based on the security rule. The proposed methodology can be used either to check a trace (offline checking) or to runtime verification (online checking) with timing constraints, including future and past time. In order to perform this: firstly, we use the Nomad language to define the security rules. Secondly, we propose an algorithm that can check simultaneously multi instances. Afterwards, with each security rule, we propose a graphical statistics, with some fixed properties, that helps the tester to easy assess about the service. In addition to the theoretical framework we have developed a software tool, called RV4WS (Runtime Verification engine for Web Service), that helps in the automation of our passive testing approach. In particular the algorithm presented in this paper is fully implemented in the tool. We also present a mechanism to collect the observable trace in this paper.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534516,Web Services Selection in Support of Reliable Web Service Choreography.,"There are two approaches to specifying the composition of Web services: orchestration and choreography. Previous works in Web services selection are mostly based on the orchestration model which focuses on the interactions with a single party. However, in many application scenarios, business goals are achieved by a number of pair-wise interactions among a set of Web services, and there does not exist a single entity that is in charge of selecting Web services for all tasks. Each Web service will autonomously perform Web services selection. In such a choreographic environment, we study the kind of information that each Web service should provide to its partner Web services and how each Web service should perform Web service selection so as to maximize the chance of successfully accomplishing a business goal. The proposed approach is evaluated by simulation, and the experimental results show that our proposed method is close to centralized method and better than the other two distributed Web services selection methods.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

Web Services for Management specification (WS-Management), as an initiative of DMTF organization, can help to manage IT resources cross multiple domains in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a novel WS-Management-based Cloud-oriented resource management model. We describe the main components of this model. And then, we discuss our management model verification experimental scheme focusing on DASH resource. Finally, we present conclusion and future work.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534518,Monitoring Prediction and Prevention of SLA Violations in Composite Services.,"We propose the PREvent framework, which is a system that integrates event-based monitoring, prediction of SLA violations using machine learning techniques, and automated runtime prevention of those violations by triggering adaptation actions in service compositions. PREvent improves on related work in that it can be used to prevent violations ex ante, before they have negatively impacted the provider's SLAs. We explain PREvent in detail and show the impact on SLA violations based on a case study.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534519,An Insuanrance Model for Guranteeing Service Assurance Integrity and QoS in Cloud Computing.,"SOA and cloud computing have brought new opportunities for the long expected agility, reuse and the adaptive capability of IT to the ever changing business requirements and environments. But due to the immature nature of the rapidly evolving technologies, especially in the areas of security, service or information integrity, privacy, quality of service and their possible detrimental consequences, many enterprises have been hesitating to make the shift. This paper adopts the concept of insurance and establishes a framework and the supporting reference model for cloud computing. We utilize the value-at-risk (VAR) approach to establish several appropriate mechanisms, and use a set of measurable metrics. Those quantitative or qualitative metrics can be applied as the basis for the business value and risk assessment, and eventually for insurance premium and compensation calculation for the failures of the services offered in Cloud environment. This model can also establish a potential new innovative market branch for the insurance industry.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534520,QSynth: A Tool for QoS-aware Automatic Service Composition.,"With the proliferation of Web services, service engineers demand good automatic service composition algorithms that not only synthesize the correct work plans from thousands of services but also satisfy the quality requirements of the users. Our observation is that conventional approaches suffer from serious limitations in scalability and accuracy when addressing both requirements simultaneously. We have designed and implemented a tool QSynth to use QoS objectives of service requests as the search directives. This approach effectively prunes the search space and significantly improves the accuracy of the search results. Evaluations show that, compared to the state of the art, QSynth achieves superior scalability and accuracy with respect to a large variety of composition scenarios. Our design of QSynth won the performance championship of Web Services Challenge 2009.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534521,An Approach for Mining Web Service Composition Patterns from Execution Logs.,"A service-oriented application is composed of several web services to provide complex functionality that a single web service cannot provide. A set of services along with their control flows can be frequently used in multiple applications. Such services form a service composition pattern which is well tested in the numerous adoptions. Reusing service composition patterns in service composition provides an efficient way to improve the quality of new applications. To facilitate the documentation of service composition patterns, we propose an approach to automatically recognize service composition patterns from various applications. We identify service composition patterns by locating a set of associated services commonly used by different applications and recovering the control flows among the set of associated services.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534522,Distributed QoS Evaluation for Real-World Web Services.,"Quality-of-Service (QoS) is widely employed for describing non-functional characteristics of Web services. Although QoS of Web services has been investigated in a lot of previous works, there is a lack of real-world Web service QoS datasets for validating new QoS based techniques and models of Web services. To study the performance of real-world Web services as well as provide reusable research datasets for promoting the research of QoS-driven Web services, we conduct several large-scale evaluations on real-world Web services. Firstly, addresses of 21,358 Web services are obtained from the Internet. Then, invocation failure probability performance of 150 Web services is assessed by 100 distributed service users. After that, response time and throughput performance of 5,825 Web services are evaluated by 339 distributed service users. Detailed experimental results are presented in this paper and comprehensive Web service QoS datasets are publicly released for future research.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534523,Message Correlation and Web Service Protocol Mining from Inaccurate Logs.,"Business process management, service-oriented architectures and software back-engineering heavily rely on the fundamental processes of mining of processes and web service business protocols from log files. Model extraction and mining aim at the (re)discovery of the behavior of a running model implementation using solely its interaction and activity traces, and no a priori information on the target model. This paper presents an approach for correlating messages and extracting the business protocol of a web service in the realistic scenario in which correlation information is entirely absent from interaction and activity logs. Correlation is achieved through deterministic computations that result in an extremely efficient method whose extensive experiments have shown its solid reliability, robustness when dealing with complex structures, and very high performance and scalability. This approach and the underlying algorithms extend what is actually possible to achieve in the web service business protocol mining domain using incomplete and noisy data logs, and opens new horizons in back-engineering of web services. The theoretical and experimental results clearly show the leap forward achieved herein.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

Such applications are more and more developed with respect of quality processes. Testability is an important quality degree, which evaluates the fault detection coverage during the testing process and the testing cost. In this paper, we focus on a well-known testability criterion called observability, which evaluates if enough distinguishable events can be observed while testing. We study the observability of ABPEL (Abstract-BPEL) specifications and we describe some ABPEL observability degradation properties. From these, we propose some observability enhancement methods which detect observability issues in ABPEL specifications and semi-automatically update the ABPEL code.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534525,WSExpress: A QoS-aware Search Engine for Web Services.,"Web services are becoming prevalent nowadays. Finding desired Web services is becoming an emergent and challenging research problem. In this paper, we present WSExpress (Web Service Express), a novel Web service search engine to expressively find expected Web services. WSExpress ranks the publicly available Web services not only by functional similarities to usersâ€™ queries, but also by nonfunctional QoS characteristics of Web services. WSExpress provides three searching styles, which can adapt to the scenario of finding an appropriate Web service and the scenario of automatically replacing a failed Web service with a suitable one. WSExpress is implemented by Java language and large-scale experiments employing real-world Web services are conducted. Totally 3,738 Web services (15,811 operations) from 69 countries are involved in our experiments. The experimental results show that our search engine can find Web services with the desired functional and non-functional requirements. Extensive experimental studies are also conducted on a well known benchmark dataset consisting of 1,000 Web service operations to show the recall and precision performance of our search engine.

1534526,Business Process Personalization Through Web Widgets.,"Widget aggregators such as iGoogle and Netvibes are broadly adopted by the mass market. They enable end-users to personalize their environment with their preferred services (Widgets). However, the usage in an enterprise context is not yet investigated. In this paper, we firstly show that in addition to personalization capability, the integration of business processes should be considered. Secondly, we propose a new Widget aggregator that enables the end-user to personalize a business process by chaining Widgets according to his/her needs and habits. Thirdly, we introduce a new approach for specifying an end-user process; an approach which enables even ordinary end-users, without computing skills, to define their processes. Finally, we validate these concepts by implementing and testing a prototype. As a consequence, this work does not only impact Widget aggregators, but it also innovates in end-user service creation research by proposing an intuitive tool, understandable even by ordinary end-users, for specifying their processes (composite services).",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534527,An Aspect-Oriented Approach to Consistency-Preserving Caching and Compression of Web Service Response Messages.,"Web Services communicate through XML-encoded messages and suffer from substantial overhead due to verbose encoding of transferred messages and extensive (de)serialization at the end-points. We demonstrate that response caching is an effective approach to reduce Internet latency and server load. Our Tantivy middleware layer reduces the volume of data transmitted without semantic interpretation of service requests or responses and thus improves the service response time. Tantivy achieves this reduction through the combined use of caching of recent responses and data compression techniques to decrease the data representation size. These benefits do not compromise the strict consistency semantics. Tantivy also decreases the overhead of message parsing via storage of application-level data objects rather than XML-representations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the use of aspect-oriented programming techniques provides modularity and transparency in the implementation. Experimental evaluations based on the WSTest benchmark suite demonstrate that our Tantivy system gives significant performance improvements compared to non-caching techniques.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534528,Combining Local Optimization and Enumeration for QoS-aware Web Service Composition.,"Web service composition, i.e., WSC, has emerged as a promising way to integrate various distributed computing resources for complex application requirements. However, much computation time is needed to determine the optimal composite solution, which embarrasses the popularity of WSC in actual real time applications. In view of this challenge, in this paper, a heuristic service composition method, named LOEM (Local Optimization and Enumeration Method, LOEM), is proposed. It aims at filtering the candidates of each task to a small number of promising ones by local selection, and then enumerates all the composite solutions to pursue a near-to-optimal one. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of LOEM in dealing with the WSC problems.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

However, supporting scalable and reliable on-demand IPTV services remains to be an important challenge. Existing IPTV architecture dedicates a centralized regional station to serve subscribers in the respective region regardless of temporal and spatial dynamics in service demand. As a result, it may cause significant imbalance of resource utilization and service provisioning delay at different stations, especially with increasing subscribers and video content. In this paper, we propose to allow IPTV stations of different regions to collaboratively serve user requests for delivering scalable and reliable IPTV services. One key challenge in achieving this station-wise collaboration is to route service requests to appropriate stations according to cost-effectiveness and load distribution in a fully distributed manner. We devise a novel request dispatching protocol which runs on each IPTV station, and yet forms a collaborative dispatching strategy that avoids hot spots and reduces service delivery cost at the same time. Our experiment results suggest that our service request dispatching algorithm significantly improves the scalability of on-demand IPTV services for the existing IPTV architecture.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534530,A Pattern-Driven Generation of Security Policies for Service-Oriented Architectures.,"Service-oriented Architectures support the provision, discovery, and usage of services in different application contexts. The Web Service specifications provide a technical foundation to implement this paradigm. Moreover, mechanisms are provided to face the new security challenges raised by SOA. To enable the seamless usage of services, security requirements can be expressed as security policies (e.g. WS-Policy and WS-SecurityPolicy) that enable the negotiation of these requirements between clients and services. However, the codification of security policies is a difficult and error-prone task due to the complexity of the Web Service specifications. In this paper, we introduce our model-driven approach that facilitates the transformation of architecture models annotated with simple security intentions to security policies. This transformation is driven by security configuration patterns that provide expert knowledge on Web Service security. Therefore, we will introduce a formalised pattern structure and a domain-specific language to specify these patterns. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

1534531,A Trust and Reputation Model Based on Bayesian Network for Web Services.,"Trust and reputation for web services emerges as an important research issue in web service selection. Current web service trust models either do not integrate different important sources of trust (subjective and objective for example), or do not focus on satisfying different userâ€™s requirements about different quality of service (QoS) attributes such as performance, availability etc. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian network trust and reputation model for web services that can overcome such limitations by considering several factors when assessing web servicesâ€™ trust: direct opinion from the truster, user rating (subjective view) and QoS monitoring information (objective view). Our comprehensive approach also addresses the problems of usersâ€™ preferences and multiple QoS-based trust by specifying different conditions for the Bayesian network and targets at building a reasonable credibility model for the raters of web services.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534532,Analyzing Behavioral Substitution of Web Services Based on Pi-calculus.,"The behavioral analysis for Web services provides a priori detection of errors to ensure successful interactions in services invocation and composition, and the behavioral substitution of Web services is one of the most important issues in such analysis. In this paper, we propose to formalize the behavior of a Web service by Ï€-calculus. Based on the formalization, we introduce two notions of behavioral substitution of Web services namely strong and weak simulation. Furthermore, we propose a derivative approach to analyzing the behavioral substitution of services according to the given notions, which is implemented based on an existing tool of Pi-calculus. The proposed approach takes advantage of formalization and theory of Pi- calculus, so that the formalized services can be naturally analyzed and the behavioral substitution of them can be easily determined.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534533,Estimating the Cost of Developing Customizations to Packaged Application Software Using Service Oriented Architecture.,"Service-oriented way of building customizations to packaged applications is an emerging alternative to the traditional way of modifying the package application directly to implement customizations. Estimating the effort at an early stage (before detailed design) in the services engagement is important to reduce the perceived risk of the new approach and to demonstrate the potential cost efficiencies. In this paper we present a method to estimate the effort and cost involved in developing customizations to packaged application software (such as SAP and Oracle ERP software) using service-oriented architecture/design (SOA) style. Taking only a description of business processes to be customized, we estimate the effort and costs of implementing those customizations. We use novel artifact-centric and linguistic analysis approaches to estimate the business object count which lies at the center of our cost estimation model. The model is currently being piloted at a large IT services organization involved in implementing packaged application software for clients. Initial experiments reveal that the cost and effort estimates are within 10% range of the benchmark estimates developed after requirements gathering and detailed design.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534534,Survey of the Tools for Automating Service Composition.,This paper presents the results of a brief survey of tools for increasing the level of automation of service composition.

1534535,Optimizing the Data-Traffic of Centrally Coordinated Scientific Workflow Systems.,"Scientific workflow systems facilitate scientific experiments by integrating and coordinating geographically distributed data and algorithmic services in a loosely coupled manner. Most scientific workflow-engines use centralized coordination as the choice of approach for executing workflows, requiring the coordinator (i.e., workflow-engine) to send and receive all input and output data of component services. Such indirect data communication between the component services increases the data-traffic of the coordinator and weakens the performance of the workflow. To optimize this, we propose an approach where data-flow is dynamically delegated from the coordinator to the component services, with direct transportation of data between the component services.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534536,Towards a Formal Verification Approach for Business Process Coordination.,"BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) enacts a process-oriented web service orchestration, and multi-business processes can be regarded as BPEL composition. A business process can be regarded as a complex set of interactions among Web services to achieve a defined goal. The achievement of distributed agreement among multiple-participant services is an orthogonal problem outside the scope of BPEL, so the rationality for distributed coordination of multi-business processes is an urgent issue to study. The definition of the message exchanges that take place between the process and each one of its partners lack the precise definition which is required for performing a formal analysis and reasoning. An integrated approach supporting a formal verification of multi-business interactions is proposed. This paper first examines a rigorous approach for the formalization of the execution semantics of business process in the Pi-calculus. Then transforms the Pi-calculus expressions into equivalent SMV code and verifies the system whether a process satisfies given properties automatically using the NuSMV model checker, and the approach is illustrated using a concrete case study subsequently. The approach supports creating robust multi-business processes which are distributed or span multiple vendors and platforms.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534537,Everett: Providing Branch-Isolation for a Data Evolution Service.,"One benefit of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the ability to rapidly deploy iterative improvements without requiring users to upgrade the application on their machine. However, the need to rapidly ""develop and test"" different versions of an application implies that developers need branch isolation to protect the system from local changes to both data and meta-data in the same way that they traditionally use branch-isolation to protect the system from source-code changes. Providing branch-isolation for source-code changes has well-known solutions, but these solutions do not extend well to providing isolation for changes to data and meta-data. Everett provides developers the ability to safely â€“ and concurrently â€“ change database values with new business logic or evolve data schema in various ways while sharing the same database.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534538,A Tripartite Security Model for Dynamic Service-Oriented Systems Using DynaSOAr.,"The DynaSOAr framework presents a wholly service-oriented approach to grid and Internet-based computing that makes a clear and explicit separation of concerns between service-provision and resource-provision for each service invocation. The separation allows the dynamic deployment of code at runtime, in the form of a service implementation, between a service provider and an explicit resource provider. This paper presents work in progress towards an integrated tripartite security model and framework that enables the security constraints of each engaging party to be expressed, propagated, unified and enforced as part of a DynaSOAr service invocation.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534539,Trust Assessment for Web Services Collaboration.,"We present in this paper a trust-based game theoretical model for Web services collaboration. The devised model is an application of the generic model about tasks allocation for agents, which is presented in [13]. We consider that a collaboration between Web services captures a possible interaction for achieving a specific task. We consider such collaboration as a game in which several Web services compete to win a task by bidding a cost for achieving it. The game winner is the Web service which has the minimal trust-based cost, which is the product of the cost and the inverse of the trust value of the bidding Web service. Initial trust values are computed based on the distance between the actual and the announced quality attribute values of a Web service. These values are computed during a collaboration evaluation period. They are updated after each game round based on a bayesian model. We show in this paper how the use of trust allows a safer collaboration between Web services with respect to collaborations where there is no consideration of the trust as a criteria for allocating tasks.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

It maps complex I/O data structures to command lines and enables dynamic allocation of computing resources; including execution on local hosts or on grid infrastructures; data transfer management and support of non-functional concerns.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534541,User Experience in Added Value Location-Based Mobile Music Service.,"In this paper, the user experience in added value location-based mobile music service called the City Night Life (CNL) is evaluated and analyzed. The CNL service provides recommendations about entertainment premises in the proximity by matching their music styles with the userâ€™s personal music preferences. Entertainment premises are shown on a map interface and are marked with colors according to their match. The paper presents the components of the CNL service, the music profile, matching algorithm and the map-based user interface in a web browser. The user evaluation with 53 test users assessed the feasibility and business potential of the CNL service. Data was collected with both quantitative questionnaires and short interviews. The results indicate that the CNL service will be most useful in relatively large, unfamiliar cities. Furthermore, the matching algorithm was perceived to perform quite well.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534542,Semi-automatic Integration of Web Service Interfaces.,"Modern information systems may exploit numerous web services for communication. Each web service may exploit its own XML format for data representation which causes problems with their integration and evolution. Manual integration and management of evolution of the XML formats may be very hard. In this paper, we present a novel method which exploits a conceptual diagram. We introduce an algorithm which helps a domain expert to map the XML formats to the conceptual diagram. It measures similarities between the XML formats and the diagram and adjusts them on the base of the input from the expert. The result is a precise mapping. The diagram then integrates the XML formats and facilitates their evolution - a change can be made only once in the diagram and propagated to the XML formats.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534543,Analyzing the Relationships between some Parameters of Web Services Reputation.,"In this paper, we provide an analysis of the impacts of some reputation parameters that an agent-based Web service holds while being active in the environment. To this end, we deploy a reputation model that ranks the Web services with respect to their popularity in the network of users. We model and analyze the arrival of requests and study their impacts on the overall reputation. The Web services may be encouraged to handle the peak loads by gathering to a group. Besides theoretical discussions, we also provide significant results, which elaborate more on the details of the system parameters. We extend the details of these results to empirical results and link the observations of the implemented environment to the results that we theoretically obtain.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534544,Compose Real Web Services with Context.,"Web service composition is to integrate existing web services to provide a compound service which satisfies specified requirement. However, traditional web service compositions fail to provide different compound services under various scenarios. In this paper, we propose an approach to compose services with context. A context ontology is defined to describe the scenario for user. An abstract service description is defined to describe current three kinds of services including WSDL/Restful/Web API. The goal is to correlate context and service composition to improve the quality of the compound service from real services. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery.

1534545,Use Cases to Process Specifications in Business Process Modeling Notation.,"Use cases are a key technique to elicit software requirements from the point of view of the user of a system. Their prevalence is noticeable ever since the onset of agile programming techniques. Within SOA projects however, business process models are used for capability analysis and gap detection. Business process models present a global view of the system and hence are more suited for gap detection. Therefore, in practice both these forms of requirements continue to be useful and coexist. Often in big software projects and in distributed development environment such coexisting requirement specifications can grow out of synch. We present here a technique to semi-automatically transform use cases into business processes and to create mapping between them. By preserving the mapping between these forms one can enforce consistency between the two forms of requirements.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

1534547,Reducing User Perceived Latency in Mobile Processes.,"Employees are increasingly participating in business processes using mobile devices. Often, this is supported by a mobile web application, which accesses various web services in the back-end. The high latency of the mobile network (e.g., EDGE) is perceived by the user each time a web service is called, in addition to the time needed to invoke the service itself. This high latency may lead to low usability, low acceptance rate, and finally compromises the overall process quality. To reduce the latency perceived by the user, we present a caching architecture for web services and an adaptive prefetching algorithm. The key characteristics of our approach are the compatibility with major mobile browsers and the independence of the caching proxy from the front-end application and the back-end services. We evaluate our approach on realistic traces of web service calls in an IT service management scenario. The traces were generated from handling real incidents according to the ITIL (ISO 20000) processes. The results confirm that using our approach, the latency perceived by the user is reduced by 24%.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534548,QoS Aware Semantic Web Service Composition Approach Considering Pre/Postconditions.,"Web service composition is a topic bringing several issues to be resolved. Our work deals with the effectiveness and scalability of service composition. During composition we consider QoS and pre-/post-conditions of single services to create a composite service satisfying the user needs the best. Regarding pre-/post-conditions we propose an approach to fast determination of which services produce results expected by the user, i.e. the post-condition of which services implicates the desired condition defined in the user goal. This paper proposes also an approach to restriction on the service space which provided a dramatic improvement in terms of composition time.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534549,WebMov: A Dedicated Framework for the Modelling and Testing of Web Services Composition.,"This paper presents a methodology and a set of tools for the modelling, validation and testing of Web service composition, conceived and developed within the French national project WebMov. This methodology includes several modelling techniques, based mainly on some variations of Timed Extended Finite State Machines (TEFSM) formalism, which provide a formal model of the BPEL description of Web services composition. These models are used as a reference for the application of different test generation and passive testing techniques for conformance and robustness checking. The whole WebMov methodology is integrated within a dedicated framework, composed by a set of tools that implement the model representation, the test generation and passive testing algorithms. This framework also permits the interaction of these tools to achieve specific modelling and testing activities in a complementary way. A case study based on a real service, a Travel Reservation Web Service, is presented as well as the results of the application of the proposed WebMov methodology and tools.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,

RFC is the standard SAP interface for communication between SAP systems. SOAP is widely used in web service solutions for its nature cross-platform characteristic. It uses platform independent eXtensible Markup Language (XML) but it introduces more latency tags to represent the data. Thus, SOAP might need more memory and transferring time. This paper studies and compares their performance characteristic with introducing an evaluation model and then evaluates them for different use cases. This work gives a practical conclusion for protocol selection in special case.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1534551,Variability Modeling and QoS Analysis of Web Services Orchestrations.,"The ever-growing choice in diverse services is making service orchestration variability an essential aspect of a composite web service. Influence of this variation on the Quality of Service (QoS) of a composite service is critical and the focus of our work. In this paper, we present a methodology to first model orchestration variability using a feature diagram (FD). The FD specifies a product line of orchestrations represented as configurations of invoked/rejected atomic services. Second, due to the potentially large set of configurations we employ combinatorial testing techniques to automatically generate configurations covering all valid pair wise interactions between services. Third, we analyze QoS variation for each configuration using probabilistic models of QoS. Using a crisis management system case study we experimentally show that pair wise generation covers all QoS outliers and eliminates analysis of > 75% of all possible configurations. The QoS analysis of the pair wise configurations reveals unsafe/ineffective configurations, helps determine realistic Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and provides valuable feedback to help remodel an orchestration.",2010,,,,,ICWS,,,
1619090,Rule-Based Coordination of Distributed Web Service Transactions.,"Current approaches to transactional support of distributed processes in service-oriented environments are limited to scenarios where the participant initiating the process maintains a controlling position throughout the lifetime of the process. This constraint impedes support of complex processes where participants may only possess limited local views on the overall process. Furthermore, there is little support of dynamic aspects: failure or exit of participants usually leads to cancelation of the whole process. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a framework that strengthens the role of the coordinator and allows for largely autonomous coordination of dynamic processes. We first discuss motivating examples and analyze existing approaches to transactional coordination. Subsequently, we present our framework TracG, which is based on WS-BusinessActivity. It contains at its core a set of rules for deciding on the ongoing confirmation or cancelation status of participants' work and protocol extensions for monitoring the progress of a process. Various types of participant vitality for a process are distinguished, facilitating the controlled exit of nonvital participants as well as continuation of a process in case of tolerable failures. The implementation of the framework is presented and discussed regarding interoperability issues.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/RiegenHFR10,60-72,3,IEEE Trans.

1619091,Event-Based Design and Runtime Verification of Composite Service Transactional Behavior.,"Different from process components, Web services are defined independently from any execution context. A key challenge of (Web) service compositions is how to ensure reliable execution. Due to their inherent autonomy and heterogeneity, it is difficult to reason about the behavior of service compositions especially in case of failures. Therefore, there is a growing interest for verification techniques which help to prevent service composition execution failures. In this paper, we propose an event-driven approach to validate the transactional behavior of service compositions. The transactional behavior verification is done either at design time to validate recovery mechanisms consistency, or after runtime to report execution deviations and repair design errors, and therefore, formally ensure service execution reliability. By using the Event Calculus formalism to specify and check the transactional behavior consistency of service composition, our approach provides a logical foundation to ensure service execution reliability.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/GaaloulBR10,32-45,3,IEEE Trans.

1619092,FACTS: A Framework for Fault-Tolerant Composition of Transactional Web Services.,"Along with the standardization of Web services composition language and the widespread acceptance of composition technologies, Web services composition is becoming an efficient and cost-effective way to develop modern business applications. As Web services are inherently unreliable, how to deliver reliable Web services composition over unreliable Web services is a significant and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose FACTS, a framework for fault-tolerant composition of transactional Web services. We identify a set of high-level exception handling strategies and a new taxonomy of transactional Web services to devise a fault-tolerant mechanism that combines exception handling and transaction techniques. We also devise a specification module and a verification module to assist service designers to construct fault-handling logic conveniently and correctly. Furthermore, we design an implementation module to automatically implement fault-handling logic in WS-BPEL. A case study demonstrates the viability of our framework and experimental results show that FACTS can improve fault tolerance of composite services with acceptable overheads.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/LiuLHX10,46-59,3,IEEE Trans.

1619093,Semantic-Based Mashup of Composite Applications.,"The need for integration of all types of client and server applications that were not initially designed to interoperate is gaining popularity. One of the reasons for this popularity is the capability to quickly reconfigure a composite application for a task at hand, both by changing the set of components and the way they are interconnected. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) has recently become a popular platform in the IT industry for building such composite applications with the integrated components being provided as Web services. A key limitation of solely Web-service-based integration is that it requires extra programming efforts when integrating non-Web service components, which is not cost-effective. Moreover, with the emergence of new standards, such as Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi), the components used in composite applications have grown to include more than just Web services. Our work enables progressive composition of non-Web-service-based components such as portlets, Web applications, native widgets, legacy systems, and Java Beans. Further, we proposed a novel application of semantic annotation together with the standard semantic Web matching algorithm for finding sets of functionally equivalent components out of a large set of available non-Web-service-based components. Once such a set is identified, the user can drag and drop the most suitable component into an Eclipse-based composition canvas. After a set of components has been selected in such a way, they can be connected by data-flow arcs, thus forming an integrated, composite application without any low-level programming and integration efforts. We implemented and conducted extensive experimental study on the above progressive composition framework on IBM's Lotus Expeditor, an extension of an SOA platform called the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) that complies with the OSGi standard.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/NguCSP10,15-Feb,3,IEEE Trans.

1619096,TQoS: Transactional and QoS-Aware Selection Algorithm for Automatic Web Service Composition.,"Web Services are the most famous implementation of service-oriented architectures that has brought some challenging research issues. One of these is the composition, i.e., the capability to recursively construct a composite Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services, which are developed by different organizations and offer diverse functionalities (e.g., ticket purchase, payment), transactional properties (e.g., compensatable or not), and Quality of Service (QoS) values (e.g., execution price, success rate). The selection of a Web service, for each activity of the workflow, meeting the user's requirements, is still an important challenge. Indeed, the selection of one Web service among a set of them that fulfill some functionalities is a critical task, generally depending on a combined evaluation of QoS. However, the conventional QoS-aware composition approaches do not consider the transactional constraints during the composition process. This paper addresses the issue of selecting and composing Web services not only according to their functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics. We propose a selection algorithm that satisfies user's preferences, expressed as weights over QoS criteria and as risk levels defining semantically the transactional requirements. Proofs and experimental results are presented.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/HaddadMR10,73-85,3,IEEE Trans.

1619097,Computing Service Skyline from Uncertain QoWS.,"The performance of a service provider may fluctuate due to the dynamic service environment. Thus, the quality of service actually delivered by a service provider is inherently uncertain. Existing service optimization approaches usually assume that the quality of service does not change over time. Moreover, most of these approaches rely on computing a predefined objective function. When multiple quality criteria are considered, users are required to express their preference over different (and sometimes conflicting) quality attributes as numeric weights. This is rather a demanding task and an imprecise specification of the weights could miss user-desired services. We present a novel concept, called p-dominant service skyline. A provider S belongs to the p-dominant skyline if the chance that S is dominated by any other provider is less than p. Computing the p-dominant skyline provides an integrated solution to tackle the above two issues simultaneously. We present a p-R-tree indexing structure and a dual-pruning scheme to efficiently compute the p-dominant skyline. We assess the efficiency of the proposed algorithm with an analytical study and extensive experiments.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/YuB10,16-29,3,IEEE Trans.

1619100,Template-Based Adaptation of Semantic Web Services with Model-Driven Engineering.,"Service-oriented enterprise systems, which tend to be heterogeneous, loosely coupled, long-lived, and continuously running, have to cope with frequent changes to their requirements and the environment. In order to address such changes, applications need to be inherently flexible and adaptive, supported by appropriate infrastructures. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach for the dynamic adaptation of Web services based on ontology-aware service templates. Model-driven engineering raises the level of abstraction from concrete Web service implementations to high-level service models, which leads to more flexible and automated adaptations through template designs and transformations. The ontological semantics enhances the service matching capabilities required by the dynamic adaptation process. Service templates are based on OWL-S descriptions and provide the necessary means to capture and parameterize specific behavior patterns of service models. In this paper, we apply our approach in the context of the EU-funded ALIVE project and illustrate, as an example, how the proposed framework supports the adaptation of the authentication mechanism used by an interactive tourist recommendation system.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/StaikopoulosCPPC10,116-130,3,IEEE Trans.

1619101,The Impact of Service Cohesion on the Analyzability of Service-Oriented Software.,"Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) is intended to improve software maintainability as businesses become more agile and underlying processes and rules change more frequently. However, to date, the impact of service cohesion on the analyzability subcharacteristic of maintainability has not been rigorously studied. Consequently, this paper extends existing notions of cohesion in the Procedural and OO paradigms in order to account for the unique characteristics of SOC, thereby supporting the derivation of design-level software metrics for objectively quantifying the degree of service cohesion. The metrics are theoretically validated, and an initial empirical evaluation using a small-scale controlled study suggests that the proposed metrics could help predict analyzability early in the Software Development Life Cycle. If future industrial studies confirm these findings, the practical applicability of such metrics is to support the development of service-oriented systems that can be analyzed, and thus maintained, more easily. In addition, such metrics could help identify design problems in existing systems.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/PerepletchikovRT10,89-103,3,IEEE Trans.

1619103,An Integrated Workbench for Model-Based Engineering of Service Compositions.,"The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) approach to building systems of application and middleware components promotes the use of reusable services with a core focus of service interactions, obligations, and context. Although services technically relieve the difficulties of specific technology dependency, the difficulties in building reusable components is still prominent and a challenge to service engineers. Engineering the behavior of these services means ensuring that the interactions and obligations are correct and consistent with policies set out to guide partners in building the correct sequences of interactions to support the functions of one or more services. Hence, checking the suitability of service behavior is complex, particularly when dealing with a composition of services and concurrent interactions. How can we rigorously check implementations of service compositions? What are the semantics of service compositions? How does deployment configuration affect service composition behavior safety? To facilitate service engineers designing and implementing suitable and safe service compositions, we present in this paper an approach to consider different viewpoints of service composition behavior analysis. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, we model service orchestration, choreography behavior, and service orchestration deployment through formal semantics applied to service behavior and configuration descriptions. Second, we define types of analysis and properties of interest for checking service models of orchestrations, choreography, and deployment. Third, we describe mechanical support by providing a comprehensive integrated workbench for the verification and validation of service compositions.",2010,3/9/16,journals/tsc/FosterUMK10,131-144,3,IEEE Trans.
